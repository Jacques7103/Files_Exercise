74 IN THE SOCIAL HISTORY of England, the English Channel, that proud sea
75 passage some three hundred and fifty miles long, has separated that
76 country from the Continent as by a great gulf or a bottomless chasm.
77 However, at its narrowest point, between Dover and Cap Gris-Nez—a
78 distance of some twenty-one and a half miles—the Channel, despite
79 any impression that storm-tossed sea travelers across it may have of
80 yawning profundities below, is actually a body of water shaped less
81 like a marine chasm than like an extremely shallow puddle. Indeed, the
82 relationship of depth to breadth across the Strait of Dover is quite
83 extraordinary, being as one to five hundred. This relationship can
84 perhaps be most graphically illustrated by drawing a section profile of
85 the Channel to scale. If the drawing were two feet long, the straight
86 line representing the level of the sea and the line representing the
87 profile of the Channel bottom would be so close together as to be
88 barely distinguishable from one another. At its narrowest part, the
89 Channel is nowhere more than two hundred and sixteen feet deep, and for
90 half of the distance across, it is less than a hundred feet deep. It is
91 just this extreme shallowness, in combination with strong winds and
92 tidal currents flowing in the Channel neck between the North Sea and
93 the Atlantic, that makes the seas of the Strait of Dover so formidable,
94 especially in the winter months. The weather is so bad during November
95 and December that the odds of a gale's occurring on any given day are
96 computed by the marine signal station at Dunkirk at one in seven,
97 and during the whole year there are only sixty periods in which the
98 weather remains decent in the Channel through a whole day. Under these
99 difficult conditions, the passage of people traveling across the
100 Channel by ferry between England and France is a notoriously trying
101 one; the experience has been mentioned in print during the last hundred
102 years in such phrases as "that fearful ordeal," "an hour and a half's
103 torture," and "that unspeakable horror." Writing in the _Revue des
104 Deux Mondes_ in 1882, a French writer named Valbert described the trip
105 from Dover to Calais as "two centuries ... of agony." Ninety-odd years
106 ago, an article dealing with the Channel passage, in _The Gentleman's
107 Magazine_, asserted that hundreds of thousands of people crossing
108 the Strait each year suffered in a manner that beggared description.
109 "Probably there is no other piece of travelling in civilized countries,
110 where, within equal times, so much suffering is endured; certainly it
111 would be hard to find another voyage of equal length which is so much
112 feared," the author said, and he went on to report that only one day
113 out of four was calm, on the average, while about three days in every
114 eight were made dreadful to passengers by heavy weather. He concluded,
115 with feeling, "What wonder that, under such circumstances, patriotism
116 often fails to survive; and that if any wish is felt in mid-Channel, it
117 is that, after all, England was not an island."
118 
119 How many Englishmen, their loyalty having been subjected to this
120 strain, might express the same wish upon safely gaining high ground
121 again is a question the writer in _The Gentleman's Magazine_ did not
122 venture to discuss. However, there is no question about the persistence
123 with which, during the past century at least, cross-Channel ferry
124 passengers have spoken about or written about the desirability of some
125 sort of dry-land passage between England and France. Engineers have
126 been attracted to the idea of constructing such a passage for at least
127 a hundred and fifty years. During that time, they have come up with
128 proposals for crossing the Channel by spanning it with great bridges,
129 by laying down submersible tubes resting on the sea bottom or floating
130 halfway between sea bed and sea level, or even by using transports
131 shaped like enormous tea wagons, whose wheels would travel along rails
132 below sea level and whose platforms would tower high above the highest
133 waves. But more commonly than by any other means, they have proposed to
134 do away with the hazards and hardships of the Channel boat crossing by
135 boring a traffic tunnel under the rock strata that lie at conveniently
136 shallow depths under sea level. The idea of a Channel tunnel, at once
137 abolishing seasickness and connecting England with the Continent by an
138 easy arterial flow of goods and travelers, always has had about it a
139 quality of grand simplicity—the simplicity of a very large extension
140 of an easily comprehended principle; in this case, digging a hole—that
141 has proved irresistible in appeal to generations not only of engineers
142 but of visionaries and promoters of all kinds.
143 
144 The tunnel seems always to have had a capacity to arouse in its
145 proponents a peculiarly passionate and unquenchable enthusiasm.
146 Men have devoted their adult lives to promoting the cause of the
147 tunnel, and such a powerful grip does the project seem to have had
148 on the imagination of its various designers that just to look at
149 some of their old drawings—depicting, for example, down to the
150 finest detail of architectural ornamentation, ventilation stations
151 for the tunnel sticking out of the surface of the Channel as ships
152 sail gracefully about nearby—one might almost think that the tunnel
153 was an accomplished reality, and the artist merely a conscientious
154 reporter of an existing scene. Such is the minute detail in which the
155 tunnel has been designed by various people that eighty-six years ago
156 the French Assembly approved a tunnel bill that specified the price
157 of railway tickets for the Channel-tunnel journey, and even contained
158 a clause requiring second-class carriages to be provided with stuffed
159 seats rather than the harder accommodations provided for third-class
160 passengers. And an Englishman called William Collard, who died in
161 1943, after occupying himself for thirty years with the problem of
162 the Channel tunnel, in 1928 wrote and published a book on the subject
163 that went so far as to work out a time-table for Channel-tunnel
164 trains between Paris and London, complete with train and platform
165 numbers and arrival and departure times at intermediate stations in
166 Kent and northern France. As for the actual engineering details, a
167 Channel tunnel has been the subject of studies that have ranged from
168 collections of mere rough guesses to the most elaborate engineering,
169 geological, and hydrographic surveys carried out by highly competent
170 civil-engineering companies. Interestingly enough, ever since the days,
171 a century or so ago, when practical Victorian engineers began taking up
172 the problem, the technical feasibility of constructing a tunnel under
173 the Channel has never really been seriously questioned. Yet, despite
174 effort piled on effort and campaign mounted on campaign, over all the
175 years, by engineers, politicians, and promoters, nobody has quite been
176 able to push the project through. Up to now, every time the proponents
177 of a tunnel have tried to advance the scheme, they have encountered
178 a difficulty harder to understand, harder to identify, and, indeed,
179 harder to break through than any rock stratum.
180 
181 The difficulty seems to lie in the degree to which, among Englishmen,
182 the Channel has been not only a body of water but a state of mind.
183 Because of the prevalence of this curious force, the history of the
184 scheme to put a tunnel below the Channel has proved almost as stormy
185 as the Channel waves themselves. Winston Churchill, in an article
186 in the London _Daily Mail_, wrote in 1936, "There are few projects
187 against which there exists a deeper and more enduring prejudice than
188 the construction of a railway tunnel between Dover and Calais. Again
189 and again it has been brought forward under powerful and influential
190 sponsorship. Again and again it has been prevented." Mr. Churchill,
191 who could never be accused of lacking understanding of the British
192 character, was obliged to add that he found the resistance to the
193 tunnel "a mystery." Some thirty-five times between 1882 and 1950
194 the subject of the Channel tunnel was brought before Parliament in
195 one form or another for discussion, and ten bills on behalf of the
196 project have been rejected or set aside. On several occasions, the
197 Parliamentary vote on the tunnel has been close enough to bring the
198 tunnel within reach of becoming a reality, and in the eighties the
199 construction of pilot tunnels for a distance under the sea from the
200 English and French coasts was even started. But always the tunnel
201 advocates have had to give way before persistent opposition, and always
202 they have had to begin their exertions all over again. Successive
203 generations of Englishmen have argued with each other—and with the
204 French, who have never showed any opposition to a Channel tunnel—with
205 considerable vehemence. The ranks of pro-tunnel people have included
206 Sir Winston Churchill (who once called the British opposition to the
207 tunnel "occult"), Prince Albert, and, at one point, Queen Victoria; and
208 the people publicly lining themselves up with the anti-tunnel forces
209 have included Lord Randolph Churchill (Sir Winston's father), Alfred,
210 Lord Tennyson, Robert Browning, Professor Thomas Huxley, and, more
211 recently, First Viscount Montgomery of Alamein. Queen Victoria, once
212 pro-tunnel, later turned anti-tunnel; her sometime Prime Minister,
213 William E. Gladstone, took an anti-tunnel position at one period when
214 he was in office, and later, out of it, turned pro-tunnel. Throughout
215 its stormy history the tunnel project has had the qualities of fantasy
216 and nightmare—a thing of airy grace and claustrophobic horror; a long,
217 bright kaleidoscope of promoters' promises and a cavern resounding with
218 Cyclopean bellowing. Proponents of the tunnel have called it an end to
219 seasickness, a boon to peace, international understanding, and trade;
220 and they have hailed it as potentially the greatest civil-engineering
221 feat of their particular century. Its opponents have referred to it
222 sharply as "a mischievous project," and they have denounced it as a
223 military menace that would have enabled the French (or Germans) to
224 use it as a means of invading England—the thought of which, in 1914,
225 caused one prominent English anti-tunneler, Admiral Sir Algernon de
226 Horsey, publicly to characterize as "unworthy of consideration" the
227 dissenting views of pro-tunnelers, whom he contemptuously referred
228 to as "those poor creatures who have no stomach for an hour's sea
229 passage, and who think retention of their dinners more important than
230 the safety of their country." Over the years, anti-tunnel forces have
231 used as ammunition an extraordinary variety of further arguments, which
232 have ranged from objections about probable customs difficulties at the
233 English and French ends of the tunnel to suspicions that a Channel
234 tunnel would make it easier for international Socialists to commingle
235 and conspire.
236 
237 Behind all these given reasons, no matter how elaborate or how special
238 they might be, there has always lurked something else, a consideration
239 more subtle, more elusive, more profound, and less answer able than
240 any specific objections to the construction of a Channel tunnel—the
241 consideration of England's traditional insular position, the feeling
242 that somehow, if England were to be connected by a tunnel with the
243 Continent, the peculiar meaning, to an Englishman, of being English
244 would never be quite the same again. It is this feeling, no doubt, that
245 in 1882 motivated an article on the tunnel, in so sober a publication
246 as _The Solicitors' Journal_, to express about it an uneasiness
247 bordering on alarm, on the ground that, if successful, the construction
248 of a tunnel would "effect a change in the natural geographical
249 condition of things." And it is no doubt something of the same feeling
250 that prompted Lord Randolph Churchill, during a speech attacking a bill
251 for a Channel tunnel before the House of Commons in 1889—the bill
252 was defeated, of course—to observe skillfully that "the reputation
253 of England has hitherto depended upon her being, as it were, _virgo
254 intacta_."
255 
256 If the proponents and promoters of the tunnel have never quite
257 succeeded in putting their project across in all the years, they have
258 never quite given up trying, either; and now, in a new strategic
259 era of nuclear rockets, a new era of transport in which air ferries
260 to the Continent carry cars as well as passengers, and a new era of
261 trade, marked by the emergence and successful growth of the European
262 Economic Community, or Common Market, the pro-tunnel forces have been
263 at it again, in what one of the leading pro-tunnelers has called
264 "a last glorious effort to get this thing through." This time they
265 have encountered what they consider to be the most encouraging kind
266 of progress in the entire history of the scheme. In April, 1960, an
267 organization called the Channel Tunnel Study Group announced, in
268 London, a new series of proposals for a Channel tunnel, based on a
269 number of recent elaborate studies on the subject. The proposals
270 called for twin parallel all-electric railway tunnels, either bored
271 or immersed, with trains that would carry passengers and transport,
272 in piggyback fashion, cars, buses, and trucks. The double tunnel, if
273 of the immersed kind, would be 26 miles long between portals. A bored
274 tunnel, as planned, would be 32 miles long and would be by far the
275 longest traffic tunnel of either the underwater or under-mountain
276 variety in the world. The longest continuous subaqueous traffic tunnel
277 in existence is the rail tunnel under the Mersey, connecting Liverpool
278 and Birkenhead, a distance of 2.2 miles; the longest rail tunnel
279 through a mountain is the Simplon Tunnel, 12.3 miles in length. The
280 Channel tunnel would run between the areas of Sangatte and Calais on
281 the French side, and between Ashford and Folkestone on the English
282 side. Trains would travel through it at an average speed of 65 miles
283 an hour, reaching 87 miles an hour in some places, and at rush hours
284 they would be capable of running 4,200 passengers and 1,800 vehicles on
285 flatcars every hour in each direction. While a true vehicular tunnel
286 could also be constructed, the obviously tremendous problems of keeping
287 it safely ventilated at present make this particular project, according
288 to the engineers, prohibitively expensive to build and maintain. The
289 train journey from London to Paris via the proposed tunnel would take
290 four hours and twenty minutes; the passenger trains would pass through
291 the tunnel in about thirty minutes. Passengers would pay 32 shillings,
292 or $4.48–$2.92 cheaper than the cost of a first-class passenger ticket
293 on the Dover-Calais sea-ferry—to ride through the tunnel; the cost
294 of accompanied small cars would be $16.48, a claimed 30 per cent less
295 than a comparable sea-ferry charge. The tunnel would take four to five
296 years to build, and the Study Group estimated that, including the rail
297 terminals at both ends, it would cost approximately $364,000,000.
298 
299 All that the Study Group, which represents British, French and American
300 commercial interests, needs to go ahead with the project and turn it
301 into a reality is—besides money, and the Study Group seems to be
302 confident that it can attract that—the approval of the British and
303 French Governments of the scheme. For all practical purposes, the
304 French Government never has had any objection to a fixed installation
305 linking both sides of the Channel, and as far as the official British
306 attitude is concerned, when the British Government announced, in
307 July, 1961, that it would seek full membership in the European Common
308 Market, most of the tunnel people felt sure that the forces of British
309 insularity which had hindered the development of a tunnel for nearly
310 a century at last had been dealt a blow to make them reel. But what
311 raised the pro-tunnelers' excitement to the greatest pitch of all was
312 the decision of the French and British Governments, last October,
313 to hold discussions on the problem of building either a bridge or a
314 tunnel. When these discussions got under way last November, the main
315 question before the negotiators was the economic practicality of such a
316 huge undertaking.
317 
318 Yet, with all the encouragement, few of the pro-tunnelers in England
319 seem willing to make a flat prediction that the British Government
320 will actively support the construction of a tunnel. They have been
321 disappointed too often. Then again, despite the generally high hopes
322 that this time the old strategic objections to the construction of a
323 tunnel have been pretty well forgotten, pro-tunnelers are well aware
324 that a number of Englishmen with vivid memories of 1940 are still
325 doubtful about the project. "The Channel saved us last time, even in
326 the age of the airplane, didn't it?" one English barrister said a while
327 ago, in talking of his feelings about building the Channel tunnel. The
328 tunnel project has the open enmity of Viscount Montgomery, who has
329 made repeated attacks on it and who in 1960 demanded, in a newspaper
330 interview, that before the Government took any stand on behalf of such
331 a project, "The British people as a whole should be consulted and
332 vote on the Channel tunnel as part of a General-Elections program."
333 And, to show that the spirit of the anti-tunnelers has not lost its
334 resilience, Major-General Sir Edward L. Spears, in the correspondence
335 columns of the London _Times_ in April of that same year, denounced
336 the latest Channel-tunnel scheme as "a plan which will not only cost
337 millions of public money, but will let loose on to our inadequate
338 roads eighteen hundred more vehicles an hour, each driven by a
339 right-of-the-road driver in a machine whose steering wheel is on the
340 left."

347 
348 THE FIRST SCHEME for the construction of a tunnel beneath the English
349 Channel was put forward in France, in 1802, by a mining engineer named
350 Albert Mathieu, who that year displayed plans for such a work in
351 Paris, at the Palais du Luxembourg and the École Nationale Supérieure
352 des Mines. Mathieu's tunnel, divided into two lengths totaling about
353 eighteen and a half miles, was to be illuminated by oil lamps and
354 ventilated at intervals by chimneys projecting above the sea into the
355 open air, and its base was to be a paved way over which relays of
356 horses would gallop, pulling coachloads of passengers and mail between
357 France and England in a couple of hours or so of actual traveling time,
358 with changes of horses being provided at an artificial island to be
359 constructed in mid-Channel. Mathieu managed to have his project brought
360 to the attention of Napoleon Bonaparte, the First Consul, who was
361 sufficiently impressed with it to bring it to the attention of Charles
362 James Fox during a personal meeting of the two men during the Peace of
363 Amiens. Fox described it as "one of the great enterprises we can now
364 undertake together." But the project got no further than this talking
365 stage. In 1803, a Frenchman named de Mottray came up with another
366 proposal for creating a passage underneath the Channel. It consisted
367 of laying down sections of a long, submerged tube on top of the sea
368 bed between England and France, the sections being linked together in
369 such a way as to form a watertight tunnel. However, Mottray's project
370 petered out quickly, too, and the subject of an undersea connection
371 between the two countries lay dormant until 1833, when it attracted the
372 attention of a man named Aimé Thomé de Gamond, a twenty-six-year-old
373 French civil engineer and hydrographer of visionary inclinations.
374 
375 Thomé de Gamond was to turn into an incomparably zealous and persistent
376 projector of ways in which people could cross between England and
377 France without getting wet or seasick; he devoted himself to the
378 problem for no less than thirty-four years, and had no hesitation in
379 exposing himself to extraordinary physical dangers in the course of his
380 researches. Unlike the plans of his predecessors, Thomé de Gamond's
381 were based upon fairly systematic hydrographic or geological surveys
382 of the Channel area. In 1833 he made the first of these surveys by
383 taking marine soundings to establish a profile of the sea bottom in a
384 line between Calais and Dover; on the basis of this, he drew up, in
385 1834, a plan for a submerged iron tube that was to be laid down in
386 prefabricated sections on the bed of the Strait of Dover and then lined
387 with masonry, the irregular bottom of the sea meanwhile having been
388 prepared to receive the tube through the leveling action of a great
389 battering-ram and rake operated from the surface by boat. By 1835,
390 Thomé de Gamond modified this scheme by eliminating the prefabricated
391 tube in favor of a movable hydrographic shield that would slowly
392 advance across the Channel bottom, leaving a masonry tube behind it
393 as it progressed. But the rate of progress, he calculated, would be
394 slow; the work was to take thirty years to complete, or fifteen years
395 if work began on two shores simultaneously. Thomé de Gamond moved on
396 to schemes for other ways of crossing the Channel, and between 1835
397 and 1836 he turned out, successively, detailed plans for five types
398 of cross-Channel bridges. They included a granite-and-steel bridge of
399 colossal proportions, and with arches "higher than the cupola of St.
400 Paul's, London," which was to be built between Ness Corner Point and
401 Calais; a flat-bottomed steam-driven concrete-and-stone ferryboat,
402 of such size as to constitute "a true floating island," which would
403 travel between two great piers each jutting out five miles into the
404 Channel between Ness Corner Point and Cap Blanc-Nez; and a massive
405 artificial isthmus of stone, which would stretch from Cap Gris-Nez
406 to Dover and block the neck of the English Channel except for three
407 transverse cuttings spanned by movable bridges, which Thomé de Gamond
408 allowed across his work for the passage of ships. Thomé de Gamond was
409 particularly fond of his isthmus scheme. He traveled to London and
410 there promoted it vigorously among interested Englishmen during the
411 Universal Exhibition of 1851, but he reluctantly abandoned it because
412 of objections to its high estimated cost of £33,600,000 and to what he
413 described as "the obstinate resistance of mariners, who objected to
414 their being obliged to ply their ships through the narrow channels."
415 
416 Such exasperating objections to joining England and France above water
417 sent Thomé de Gamond back to the idea of doing the job under the sea,
418 and between 1842 and 1855 he made various energetic explorations of
419 the Channel area in an attempt to determine the feasibility of driving
420 a tunnel through the rock formations under the Strait. Geological
421 conditions existing in the middle of the Strait were, up to that time,
422 almost entirely a matter of surmise, based on observations made on the
423 British and French sides of the Channel, and in the process of finding
424 out more about them, Thomé de Gamond decided to descend in person to
425 the bottom of the Channel to collect geological specimens. In 1855,
426 at the age of forty-eight, he had the hardihood to make a number of
427 such descents, unencumbered by diving equipment, in the middle of the
428 Strait. Naked except for wrappings that he wound about his head to
429 keep in place pads of buttered lint he had plastered over his ears, to
430 protect them from high water pressure, he would plunge to the bottom
431 of the Channel, weighted down by bags of flints and trailing a long
432 safety line attached to his body, and a red distress line attached
433 to his left arm, from a rowboat occupied also by a Channel pilot, a
434 young assistant, and his own daughter, who went along to keep watch
435 over him. On the deepest of these descents, at a point off Folkestone,
436 Thomé de Gamond, having put a spoonful of olive oil into his mouth as
437 a lubricant that would allow him to expel air from his lungs without
438 permitting water at high pressure to force its way in, dived down
439 weighted by four bags of flints weighing a total of 180 pounds. About
440 his waist he wore a belt of ten inflated pig's bladders, which were to
441 pull him rapidly to the surface after he had scooped up his geological
442 specimen from the Channel bed and released his ballast, and, using
443 this system, he actually touched bottom at a depth of between 99 and
444 108 feet. His ascent from this particular dive was not unremarkable,
445 either; in an account of it, he wrote that just after he had left the
446 bottom of the Channel with a sample of clay
447 
448  ... I was attacked by voracious fish, which seized me by the legs
449  and arms. One of them bit me on the chin, and would at the same time
450  have attacked my throat if it had not been preserved by a thick
451  handkerchief.... I was fortunate enough not to open my mouth, and
452  I reappeared on top of the water after being immersed fifty-two
453  seconds. My men saw one of the monsters which had assailed me, and
454  which did not leave me until I had reached the surface. They were
455  conger eels.
456 
457 Thomé de Gamond's geological observations, although they were certainly
458 sketchy by later standards, were enough to convince him of the
459 feasibility of a mined tunnel under the Channel, and in 1856 he drew
460 up plans for such a work. This was to be a stone affair containing a
461 double set of railroad tracks. It was to stretch twenty-one miles, from
462 Cap Gris-Nez to Eastwear Point, and from these places was to connect,
463 by more than nine miles at each end of sloping access tunnels, with
464 the French and British railway systems. The junctions of the sloping
465 access tunnels and the main tunnel itself were to be marked by wide
466 shafts, about three hundred feet deep, at the bottom of which travelers
467 would encounter the frontier stations of each nation. The line of the
468 main tunnel was to be marked above the surface by a series of twelve
469 small artificial islands made of stone. These were to be surmounted
470 with lighthouses and were to contain ventilating shafts connecting with
471 the tunnel. Thomé de Gamond prudently provided the ventilation shafts
472 in his plans with sea valves, so that in case of war between England
473 and France each nation would have the opportunity of flooding the
474 tunnel on short notice. The tunnel was designed to cross the northern
475 tip of the Varne, a narrow, submerged shelf that lies parallel to the
476 English coast about ten miles off Folkestone, and so close to the
477 surface that at low tide it is only about fifteen feet under water at
478 its highest point. Thomé de Gamond planned to raise the Varne above
479 water level, thus converting it into an artificial island, by building
480 it up with rocks and earth brought to the spot in ships. Through this
481 earth, engineers would dig a great shaft down to the level of the
482 tunnel, so that the horizontal mining of the tunnel as a whole could
483 be carried on from four working faces simultaneously, instead of only
484 two. The great shaft was also to serve as a means of ventilating the
485 tunnel and communicating with it from the outside, and around its apex
486 Thomé de Gamond planned, with a characteristically grand flourish, an
487 international port called the Étoile de Varne, which was to have four
488 outer quays and an interior harbor, as well as amenities such as living
489 quarters for personnel and a first-class lighthouse. As for the shaft
490 leading down to the railway tunnel, according to alternate versions of
491 Thomé de Gamond's plan, it was to be at least 350 feet—and possibly
492 as much as 984 feet—in diameter, and 147 feet deep; and, according to
493 a contemporary account in the Paris newspaper _La Patrie_, "an open
494 station [would be] formed as spacious as the court of the Louvre, where
495 travelers might halt to take air after running a quarter of an hour
496 under the bottom of the Strait."
497 
498 From the bottom of this deep station, trains might also ascend by
499 means of gently spiraling ramps to the surface of the Étoile de Varne,
500 _La Patrie_ reported. The newspaper went on to invite its readers to
501 contemplate the panorama at sea level:
502 
503  Imagine a train full of travelers, after having run for fifteen
504  minutes in the bowels of the earth through a splendidly lighted
505  tunnel, halting suddenly under the sky, and then ascending to the
506  quays of this island. The island, rising in mid-sea, is furnished
507  with solid constructions, spacious quays garnished with the ships of
508  all nations; some bound for the Baltic or the Mediterranean, others
509  arriving from America or India. In the distance to the North, her
510  silver cliffs extending to the North, reflected in the sun, is white
511  Albion, once separated from all the world, now become the British
512  Peninsula. To the South ... is the land of France.... Those white
513  sails spread in the midst of the Straits are the fishing vessels of
514  the two nations.... Those rapid trains which whistle at the bottom of
515  the subterranean station are from London or Paris in three or four
516  hours.
517 
518 In the spring of 1856, Thomé de Gamond obtained an audience with
519 Napoleon III and expounded his latest plan to him. The Emperor reacted
520 with interest and told the engineer that he would have a scientific
521 commission look into the matter "as far as our present state of science
522 allows." The commission found itself favorable to the idea of the work
523 in general but lacking a good deal of necessary technical information,
524 and it suggested that some sort of preliminary agreement between the
525 British and French Governments on the desirability of the tunnel ought
526 to be reached before a full technical survey was made. Encouraged by
527 the way things seemed to be going, Thomé de Gamond set about promoting
528 his scheme more energetically than ever. He obtained a promise of
529 collaboration from three of Britain's most eminent engineers—Robert
530 Stephenson, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, and Joseph Locke—and in 1858 he
531 traveled to London to advance the cause of the tunnel among prominent
532 people and to promote it in the press. Leading journals were receptive
533 to the idea. An article in the _Illustrated London News_ referred to
534 the proposed tunnel as "this great line of junction," and said that
535 it would put an end to the commercial isolation that England was
536 being faced with by the creation on the Continent of a newly unified
537 railway system that was making it possible to ship goods from Central
538 to Western Europe without breaking bulk. The article added that the
539 creation of the tunnel
540 
541  ... would still preserve for this country for the future that maritime
542  isolation which formed its strength throughout the past; for the
543  situation of the tunnel beneath the bed of the sea would enable the
544  government on either coast, in case of war, as a means of defense,
545  to inundate it immediately.... According to the calculations of the
546  engineer, the tunnel might be completely filled with water in the
547  course of an hour, and afterwards three days would be required, with
548  the mutual consent of the two Governments, to draw off the water, and
549  reestablish the traffic.
550 
551 Thomé de Gamond's visit to England was climaxed by a couple of
552 interviews on the subject of the Channel tunnel that he obtained with
553 Prince Albert, who supported the idea with considerable enthusiasm and
554 even took up the matter in private with Queen Victoria. The Queen,
555 who was known to suffer dreadfully from seasickness, told Albert,
556 who relayed the message to Thomé de Gamond, "You may tell the French
557 engineer that if he can accomplish it, I will give him my blessing in
558 my own name and in the name of all the ladies of England." However, in
559 a discussion Thomé de Gamond had earlier had with Her Majesty's Prime
560 Minister, Lord Palmerston, who was present at one of the engineer's
561 interviews with Albert, the idea of the tunnel was not so well
562 received. The engineer found Palmerston "rather close" on the subject.
563 "What! You pretend to ask us to contribute to a work the object of
564 which is to shorten a distance which we find already too short!"
565 Thomé de Gamond quoted him as exclaiming when the tunnel project was
566 mentioned. And, according to an account by the engineer, when Albert,
567 in the presence of both men, spoke favorably of the benefits to England
568 of a passage under the Channel, Lord Palmerston "without losing that
569 perfectly courteous tone which was habitual with him" remarked to the
570 Prince Consort, "You would think quite differently if you had been born
571 on this island."
572 
573 While Thomé de Gamond was occupied with his submarine-crossing
574 projects, other people were producing their own particular tunnel
575 schemes. Most of them seem to have been for submerged tubes, either
576 laid down directly on the sea bed or raised above its irregularities by
577 vertical columns to form a sort of underwater elevated railway. Perhaps
578 the most ornamental of these various plans was drawn up by a Frenchman
579 named Hector Horeau, in 1851. It called for a prefabricated iron tube
580 containing a railway to be laid across the Channel bed along such
581 judiciously inclined planes as to allow his carriages passage through
582 them without their having to be drawn by smoke-bellowing locomotives—a
583 suffocatingly real problem that most early Channel-tunnel designers,
584 including, apparently, Thomé de Gamond, pretty well ignored. The slope
585 given to Horeau's underground railway was to enable the carriages to
586 glide down under the Channel from one shoreline with such wonderful
587 momentum as to bring them to a point not far from the other, the
588 carriages being towed the rest of the way up by cables attached to
589 steam winches operated from outside the tunnel exit. The tunnel
590 itself would be lighted by gas flames and, in daytime, by thick glass
591 skylights that would admit natural light filtering down through the
592 sea. The line of the tube was to be marked, across the surface of the
593 Channel, by great floating conical structures resembling pennanted
594 pavilions in some medieval tapestry. The pavilions were to be held in
595 place by strong cables anchored to the Channel bottom; they were also
596 to contain marine warning beacons. This project never got under the
597 ground.
598 
599 In 1858, an attempt to assassinate Napoleon III brought France into the
600 Italian war against Austria, and when word spread in France that the
601 assassin's bombs had been made in Birmingham, a chill developed between
602 the French and British Governments. This led to a wave of fear in
603 England that another Napoleon might try a cross-Channel invasion. All
604 this froze out Thomé de Gamond's tunnel-promoting for several years.
605 He did not try again until 1867, when he exhibited a set of revised
606 plans for his Varne tunnel at the Universal Exhibition in Paris. In
607 doing so he concluded that he had pushed the cause of the tunnel about
608 to the limit of his personal powers. Thirty-five years of work devoted
609 to the problem had cost him a moderate personal fortune, and he was
610 obliged to note in presenting his plan that "the work must now be
611 undertaken by collective minds well versed in the physiology of rocks
612 and the workings of subterranean deposits." After that, Thomé de Gamond
613 retired into the background, squeezed out, it may be, by other tunnel
614 promoters. In 1875, an article in the London _Times_ that mentioned his
615 name in passing reported that he was "living in humble circumstances,
616 his daughter supporting him by giving lessons on the piano." He died in
617 the following year.
618 
619 Although Thomé de Gamond's revised plan of 1867 came to nothing in
620 itself, it did cause renewed talk about a Channel tunnel. The new
621 spirit of free trade was favorable to it among Europeans, and everybody
622 was being greatly impressed with reports of the striking progress on
623 various great European engineering projects of the time that promised
624 closer communication between nations—the successful cutting of the
625 Isthmus of Suez, the near completion of the 8.1-mile-long Mount Cenis
626 rail tunnel, and the opening, only a few years previously, of the
627 9.3-mile-long St. Gotthard Tunnel, for example. Hardly any great
628 natural physical barriers between neighboring nations seemed beyond the
629 ability of the great nineteenth-century engineers to bridge or breach,
630 and to many people it appeared logical enough that the barrier of the
631 Dover Strait should have its place on the engineers' list of conquests.
632 In this generally propitious atmosphere, an Englishman named William
633 Low took up where Thomé de Gamond left off. Shortly after the Universal
634 Exhibition, Low came up with a Channel tunnel scheme based principally
635 upon his own considerable experience as an engineer in charge of coal
636 mines in Wales. Low proposed the creation of a pair of twin tunnels,
637 each containing a single railway track, and interconnected at intervals
638 by short cross-passages. The idea was a technically striking one, for
639 it aimed at making the tunnels, in effect, self-ventilating by making
640 use of the action of a train entering a tunnel to push air in front
641 of it and draw fresh air in behind itself. According to Low's scheme,
642 this sort of piston action, repeated on a big scale by the constant
643 passage of trains bound in opposite directions in the two tunnels, was
644 supposed to keep air moving along each of the tunnels and between them
645 through the cross-passages in such a way as to allow for its steady
646 replenishment through the length of the tunnels. With modifications,
647 Low's concept of a double self-ventilating tunnel forms the basis for
648 the plan most seriously advanced by the Channel Tunnel Study Group in
649 1960.
650 
651 After showing his plans to Thomé de Gamond, who approved of them, Low
652 obtained the collaboration of two other Victorian engineers—Sir John
653 Hawkshaw, who in 1865 and 1866 had had a number of test borings made
654 by a geologist named Hartsink Day in the bed of the Channel in the
655 areas between St. Margaret's Bay, just east of Dover, and Sangatte,
656 just north-east of Calais, and had become convinced that a Channel
657 tunnel was a practical possibility in geological terms; and Sir James
658 Brunlees, an engineer who had helped build the Suez Canal. In 1867,
659 an Anglo-French committee of Channel-tunnel promoters submitted a
660 scheme for a Channel tunnel based on Low's plan to a commission of
661 engineers under Napoleon III, and the promoters asked for an official
662 concession to build the tunnel. The members of the commission were
663 unanimous in regarding the scheme as a workable one, although they
664 balked at an accompanying request of the promoters that the British
665 and French Governments each guarantee interest on a million sterling,
666 which would be raised privately, to help get the project under way, and
667 took no action. But apart from the question of money the promoters were
668 encouraged. In 1870 they persuaded the French Government officially to
669 ask the British Government what support it would be willing to give to
670 the proposed construction of a Channel railway tunnel. Consideration of
671 the question in Whitehall got sidetracked for a while by the outbreak
672 of the Franco-Prussian war in the same year, but in 1872, after further
673 diplomatic enquiries by the French Government, the British Government
674 eventually replied that it found no objection "in principle" to a
675 Channel tunnel, provided it was not asked to put up money or guarantee
676 of any kind in connection with it and provided that ownership of the
677 tunnel would not be a perpetual private monopoly. In the same year,
678 a Channel Tunnel Company was chartered in England, with Lord Richard
679 Grosvenor, chairman of the London, Chatham & Dover Railway, at its
680 head, and with Hawkshaw, Low, and Brunlees as its engineers. The
681 tunnel envisioned by the company would stretch from Dover to Sangatte,
682 and its cost, including thirty-three miles of railway that would
683 connect on the English side with the London, Chatham & Dover and the
684 South-Eastern Railways, and on the French side with the Chemin de Fer
685 du Nord, would be £10,000,000. Three years later, the English company
686 sought and obtained from Parliament temporary powers to buy up private
687 land at St. Margaret's Bay, in Kent, for the purpose of going ahead
688 with experimental tunneling work there. At the same time, a newly
689 formed French Channel Tunnel Company backed by the House of Rothschild
690 and headed by an engineer named Michel Chevalier obtained by act of
691 the French legislature permission from the French Government to start
692 work on a tunnel from the French side at an undetermined point between
693 Boulogne and Calais, and a concession to operate the French section
694 of the tunnel for ninety-nine years. The _cahier des charges_ of the
695 French tunnel bill dealt in considerable detail with the terms under
696 which the completed tunnel was to be run, down to providing a full
697 table of tariffs for the under-Channel railroad. Thus, a first-class
698 passenger riding through the tunnel in an enclosed carriage furnished
699 with windows would be charged fifty centimes per kilometre. Freight
700 rates were established for such categories as furniture, silks, wine,
701 oysters, fresh fish, oxen, cows, pigs, goats, and horse-drawn carriages
702 with or without passengers inside.
703 
704 The greatest uncertainty facing the two companies, now that they had
705 the power to start digging toward each other's working sites, consisted
706 of their lack of foreknowledge of geological obstacles they might
707 encounter in the rock masses lying between the two shores at the neck
708 of the Channel. However, the companies' engineers had substantial
709 reasons for believing that, in general, the region and stratum into
710 which they planned to take the tunnel were peculiarly suited to their
711 purpose. Their belief was based on a rough reconstruction—a far more
712 detailed reconstruction is available nowadays, of course—of various
713 geological events occurring in the area before there ever was a
714 Channel. A hundred million years ago, in the Upper Cretaceous period
715 of the Mesozoic era, a great part of southern England, which had been
716 connected at its easterly end with the Continental land mass, was
717 inundated, along with much of Western Europe, by the ancient Southern
718 Sea. As it lay submerged, this sea-washed land accumulated on its
719 surface, over a period of ten million years, layers of white or whitish
720 mud about nine hundred feet thick and composed principally of the
721 microscopic skeletons of plankton and tiny shells. Eventually the mud
722 converted itself into rock. Then, for another forty million years, at
723 just the point where the neck of the Dover Strait now is, very gentle
724 earth movements raised the level of this rock to form a bar-shaped
725 island some forty miles long. By Eocene times this Wealden Island,
726 stretching westward across the Calais-Dover area, actually seems to
727 have been the only bit of solid ground standing out in a seascape of
728 a Western Europe inundated by the Eocene sea. When most of France and
729 southern England reappeared above the surface, in Miocene times, this
730 island welded them together; later, in the ice age, the Channel isthmus
731 disappeared and emerged again four times with the rise and fall of the
732 sea caused by the alternate thawing and refreezing of the northern
733 icecap. When each sequence of the ice age ended, the land bridge
734 remained, high and dry as ever, and it was over this isthmus that
735 paleolithic man shambled across from the Continent, in the trail of
736 rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, giant boars, and other great beasts whose
737 fossilized bones have been found in the Wealden area.
738 
739 Encroaching seas made a channel through the isthmus and cut the Bronze
740 Age descendants of this breed of men off from the Continent about six
741 thousand years ago. Then fierce tidal currents coursing between the
742 North Sea and the Atlantic widened the breach still further until, as
743 recently as four thousand years ago (or only about a couple of thousand
744 years before Caesar's legions invaded Britain by boat), the sea wore
745 away the rock of the isthmus to approximately the present width of
746 the Strait, leaving exposed high at each side the eroded rock walls,
747 formerly the whitish mudbank of Cretaceous times—now the white chalk
748 cliffs of the Dover and Calais areas. Providentially for the later
749 purposes of Channel tunnelers, however, the seas that divided England
750 from the Continent also left behind them a thin remnant of the old land
751 connection in the form of certain chalk layers that still stretched
752 in gentle folds across the bottom of the Strait, and it was through
753 this area of remaining chalk that the Victorian engineers planned to
754 drive their tunnel headings. Even more providentially, they had the
755 opportunity of extending their headings under the Channel through a
756 substratum of chalk almost ideal for tunneling purposes, known as the
757 Lower Chalk. Unlike the two layers of cretaceous rock that lie above
758 it—the white Upper Chalk and the whitish Middle Chalk, both of which
759 are flint-laden, heavily fissured, and water-bearing, and consequently
760 almost impossible to tunnel in for any distance—the Lower Chalk (it
761 is grayish in color) is virtually flint-free and nearly impermeable
762 to water, especially in the lower parts of the stratum, where it is
763 mixed with clay; at the same time it is stable, generally free of
764 fissures, and easy to work. From the coastline between Folkestone and
765 South Foreland, north-east of Dover, where its upper level is visible
766 in the cliffs, the Lower Chalk dips gently down into the Strait in a
767 north-easterly direction and disappears under an outcropping Middle
768 Chalk, and emerges again on the French side between Calais and Cap
769 Blanc-Nez. Given this knowledge and their knowledge of the state of
770 Lower Chalk beds on land areas, the Victorian engineers were confident
771 that the ribbon of Lower Chalk extending under the Strait would turn
772 out to be a continuous one. To put this view to a further test, the
773 French Channel Tunnel Company, in 1875, commissioned a team of eminent
774 geologists and hydrographers to make a more detailed survey of the
775 area than had yet been attempted. In 1875 and 1876 the surveyors made
776 7,700 soundings and took 3,267 geological samples from the bed of the
777 Strait and concluded from their studies that, except for a couple of
778 localities near each shoreline, which a tunnel could avoid, the Lower
779 Chalk indeed showed every sign of stretching without interruption or
780 fault from shore to shore. However, when these studies were completed,
781 Lord Grosvenor's Channel Tunnel Company did not find itself in a
782 position to do much about them. The company was having trouble raising
783 money, and its temporary power to acquire land at St. Margaret's
784 Bay for experimental workings had lapsed without the promoters ever
785 having used it. William Low, who had left the company in 1873 after
786 disagreements with Hawkshaw on technical matters—Low had come to
787 believe, for one thing, that the terrain around St. Margaret's Bay was
788 unsuitable as a starting place for a channel tunnel—had become the
789 chief engineering consultant of a rival Channel-tunnel outfit that
790 called itself the Anglo-French Submarine Railway Company. But the
791 Anglo-French Submarine Railway Company wasn't getting anywhere, either.
792 It remained for a third English company, headed by a railway magnate
793 named Sir Edward Watkin, to push the Channel-tunnel scheme into its
794 next phase, which turned out to be the most tumultuous one in all its
795 history.

876  THREE SOLUTIONS TO THE INVASION PROBLEM
877 
878  How to have a tunnel and still keep England safe from invasion is a
879  problem that has attracted the attention of artists since the eighties.
880 
881  The _Illustrated London News_, 1882, shows how, at
882  the first sign of invasion, the tunnel could be bombarded from the
883  Admiralty Pier at Dover, from the Dover fortifications, and from
884  positions offshore.
885 
886  Viaduct for the French tunnel entrance proposed in 1906.
887  At signs of French intentions to invade, the British fleet would sail
888  up and blow this viaduct to smithereens, thus blocking the tunnel from
889  the French end.
890 
891  David Langdon in _Paris Match_, 1960, suggests another way of
892  handling the invasion problem.]

919 SIR EDWARD WATKIN was a vociferously successful promoter from the
920 Midlands. The son of a Manchester cotton merchant, Watkin had passed up
921 a chance at the family business in favor of railways in the early days
922 of the age of steam, and it is a measure of his generally acknowledged
923 shrewdness at railway promotion that in his mid-twenties, having become
924 secretary of the Trent Valley Railway, he negotiated its sale to the
925 London North Western Railway at a profit of £438,000. Now in his early
926 sixties, Watkin was chairman of three British railway companies, the
927 Manchester, Sheffield Lincolnshire Railway, the Metropolitan (London)
928 Railway, and the South-Eastern Railway—the last-named being a company
929 whose line ran from London to Dover via Folkestone—and one of his big
930 current schemes was the formation of a through route under a single
931 management—his own, naturally—from Manchester and the north to
932 Dover. It was while he was busily promoting this scheme that Watkin
933 caught the Channel-tunnel fever. He realized that part of the land
934 the South-Eastern Railway owned along its line between Folkestone and
935 Dover lay happily accessible to the ribbon of Lower Chalk that dipped
936 into the sea in the direction of Dover and stretched under the bed of
937 the Strait, and it wasn't long before he was conjuring up visions of a
938 great system in which his projected Manchester-Dover line, instead of
939 stopping at the Channel shoreline, would carry on under the Strait to
940 the Continent.
941 
942 One of Sir Edward Watkin's first steps toward determining the technical
943 feasibility of constructing a tunnel was to call in, sometime in
944 the mid-seventies, William Low, whose own tunnel company had quite
945 fallen apart, for engineering consultation. Watkin decided to aim
946 for a twin tunnel based on Low's idea, which would have its starting
947 point in the area west of Dover and east of Folkestone, and he put
948 his own engineers to work on the job. In 1880, the engineers sank a
949 seventy-four-foot shaft by the South-Eastern Railway line at Abbots
950 Cliff, about midway between Folkestone and Dover, and began driving a
951 horizontal pilot gallery seven feet in diameter along the Lower Chalk
952 bed in the direction of the sea off Dover. By the early part of the
953 following year, the experimental heading extended about half a mile
954 underground. His engineers having satisfied themselves that the Lower
955 Chalk was lending itself as well as expected to being tunneled, Sir
956 Edward went ahead and formed the Submarine Continental Railway Company,
957 capitalized at £250,000 and closely controlled by the South-Eastern
958 Railway Company, to take over the existing tunnel workings and to
959 continue them on a larger scale, with the aim of constructing a Channel
960 tunnel connecting with the South-Eastern's coastal rail line. At the
961 same time, he reached an understanding with the French Channel Tunnel
962 Company on co-ordination of English and French operations; he also
963 engineered through Parliament—he was an M.P. himself, and that helped
964 things a bit—a bill giving the South-Eastern power to carry out the
965 compulsory purchase of certain coastal land in the general direction
966 taken by the existing heading.
967 
968 Then Sir Edward's engineers sank a second shaft, farther to the east
969 but in alignment with the first heading, 160 feet below a level
970 stretch of ground by the South-Eastern Railway line at Shakespeare
971 Cliff, just west of Dover, 120 feet below high water, and began boring
972 a new seven-foot pilot tunnel that dipped down with the Lower Chalk
973 bed leading into the Channel. This second boring, like the first, was
974 carried out with the use of a tunneling machine especially designed
975 for the purpose by Colonel Frederick Beaumont, an engineer who had had
976 a hand in the construction of the Dover fortifications. The Beaumont
977 tunneling machine, a prototype of some of the most powerful tunneling
978 machines in use nowadays, was run by compressed air piped in from the
979 outside, and the discharge of this air from the machine as it worked
980 also served as a way of keeping the gallery ventilated. The cutting of
981 the rock was done by a total of fourteen steel planetary cutters set in
982 two revolving arms at the head of the machine; with each turn of the
983 borer a thin paring of chalk 5/16 of an inch thick was shorn away from
984 the working face, the spoil being passed by conveyor belt to the back
985 of the machine and dumped into carts or skips that were pushed by hand
986 along the length of the gallery on narrow-gauge rails. The machine made
987 one and a half to two revolutions a minute, and Sir Edward estimated
988 for his stockholders that with simultaneous tunneling with the use of
989 similar equipment from the French shore—the French Tunnel Company had
990 already sunk a 280-foot shaft of its own at Sangatte and was preparing
991 to drive a gallery toward England—the Channel bottom would be pierced
992 from shore to shore by a continuous single pilot tunnel, twenty-two
993 miles long, in three and a half years. Once this was done, according
994 to Sir Edward's plans, the seven-foot gallery was to be enlarged by
995 special cutting machinery to a fourteen-foot diameter, and a double
996 tunnel, thickly lined with concrete and connected by cross-passages,
997 constructed. (Four miles of access tunnel were to be added on the
998 French, and possibly on the English, side, too.) The completed tunnel
999 was to be lighted throughout by electric light—a novelty already being
1000 tried out in the pilot tunnel by the well-known electrical engineer
1001 C. W. Siemens—and the trains that ran through it between France and
1002 Britain were to be hauled by locomotives designed by Colonel Beaumont.
1003 Instead of being run by smoke-producing coal, the locomotives were to
1004 be propelled by compressed air carried behind the engine in tanks,
1005 and, like the Beaumont tunneling machine, the engine was supposed to
1006 keep the tunnel ventilated by giving out fresh air as it went along.
1007 (A lot of air was to be released in the tunnel in the course of a
1008 day; a tentative schedule called for one train to traverse it in one
1009 direction or another every five minutes or so for twenty hours out of
1010 the twenty-four.)
1011 
1012 Trains coming through the tunnel from France were to emerge into
1013 the daylight and the ordinary open air of England either from a
1014 four-mile-long access tunnel connected to the South-Eastern's railway
1015 line at Abbots Cliff or—this was a favored alternative plan of Sir
1016 Edward's—at Shakespeare Cliff via a station to be constructed in a
1017 great square excavated a hundred and sixty feet deep in the ground,
1018 which would be covered over with glass, lighted by electric light, and
1019 equipped "with large waiting rooms and refreshment rooms." From the
1020 abyss of this submerged station, trains arriving from the Continent
1021 were to be raised, an entire train at a time, to the level of the
1022 existing South-Eastern line by a giant hydraulic lift. (Actually,
1023 constructing an elevator capable of raising such an enormous load would
1024 not seem as unlikely a feat in the eighties as it might to many people
1025 now; Victorian engineers were expert in the use of hydraulic power
1026 for ship locks and all sorts of other devices, and, in fact, hydraulic
1027 power was so commonly used that the London of half a century ago had
1028 perhaps eight hundred miles of hydraulic piping laid below the streets
1029 to work industrial presses, motors, and most of the cranes on the
1030 Thames docks.)
1031 
1032 As the experimental work progressed, Sir Edward Watkin saw to it
1033 that all the splendid details about the Channel-tunnel scheme
1034 were constantly brought to the attention of the South-Eastern's
1035 shareholders, the press, and the public. Sir Edward, besides
1036 being a nineteenth-century railway king, was also something of a
1037 twentieth-century public-relations operator. He was a firm believer in
1038 the beneficial effects of giving big dinners, a pioneer in the art of
1039 organizing big junkets, and an adept at getting plenty of newspaper
1040 space. An energetic lobbyist in Parliament for all sorts of causes,
1041 not excluding his own commercial projects, he was known as a habitual
1042 conferrer of friendly little gestures upon important people in and out
1043 of government, and his kindness is said to have gone so far at one
1044 time that he provided Mr. Gladstone with the convenience of a private
1045 railway branch line that went right to the statesman's country home.
1046 
1047 The driving of the Channel-tunnel pilot gallery at Shakespeare Cliff
1048 offered Sir Edward a handy opportunity for exercising his gifts in
1049 the field of public relations, and he took full advantage of it. Week
1050 after week, as the boring of the tunnel progressed, he invited large
1051 groups of influential people, as many as eighty at a time, including
1052 politicians and statesmen, editors, reporters, and artists, members
1053 of great families, well-known financiers and businessmen from Britain
1054 and abroad, and members of the clergy and the military establishment
1055 to be his guests on a trip by special train from London to Dover at
1056 Shakespeare Cliff. There, at the Submarine Continental Railway Company
1057 workings, the visitors were taken down into the tunnel to inspect the
1058 creation of the new experimental highway to the Continent. A typical
1059 enough descriptive paragraph in the press concerning one of these
1060 visits (on this occasion a group of prominent Frenchmen were the guests
1061 of Sir Edward) is contained in a contemporary report in the _Times_:
1062 
1063  The visitors were lowered six at a time in an iron "skip" down the
1064  shaft into the tunnel. At the bottom of this shaft, 163 feet below
1065  the surface of the ground, the mouth of the tunnel was reached, and
1066  the visitors took their seats on small tramcars which were drawn by
1067  workmen. So evenly has the boring machine done its work that one
1068  seemed to be looking along a great tube with a slightly downward
1069  set, and as the glowing electric lamps, placed alternately on either
1070  side of the way, showed fainter and fainter in the far distance, the
1071  tunnel, for anything one could tell from appearances, might have had
1072  its outlet in France.
1073 
1074 Sir Edward Watkin, in a speech he made at a Submarine Continental
1075 Railway Company stockholders' meeting shortly after such a visit (the
1076 main parts of the speech were duly paraphrased in the press), found the
1077 effect of the electric light (operated on something called the Swan
1078 system) in the tunnel to be just as striking as the _Times_ reporter
1079 had—only brighter.
1080 
1081  He thought the visit might be regarded as a remarkable one. Their
1082  colleague, Dr. Siemens, lighted up the tunnel with the Swan light, and
1083  it was certainly a beautiful sight to see a cavern, as it were, under
1084  the bottom of the sea made in places as brilliant as daylight.
1085 
1086 While on their way by tramcar to view the working of Colonel Beaumont's
1087 boring machine at the far end of the tunnel, visitors stopped after a
1088 certain distance to enjoy another experience—a champagne party held
1089 in a chamber cut in the side of the tunnel. A contemporary artist's
1090 sketch in the _Illustrated London News_ records the sight of a group of
1091 visitors clustered around a bottle-laden table at one of these way side
1092 halts. Mustachioed and bearded, and wearing Sherlock Holmes deerstalker
1093 caps and dust jackets, they are shown, in tableaued dignity, standing
1094 about within a solidly timbered cavelike area with champagne glasses
1095 in their hands; and for all the Victorian pipe-trouser formality of
1096 their posture there is no doubt that the subjects are having a good
1097 time. After such a refreshing pause, the visitors would be helped on
1098 the tramcars again and escorted on to see the boring machine cutting
1099 through the Lower Chalk and to admire the generally dry appearance of
1100 the tunnel, and after that they would be taken back to the surface and
1101 given a splendid lunch either in a marquee set up near the entrance to
1102 the shaft or at the Lord Warden Hotel, in Dover, where more champagne
1103 would be served, along with other wines and brandies, more toasts to
1104 the Queen's health proposed, and speeches made on the present and
1105 future marvels of the tunnel, the forwardness of its backers, and the
1106 new era in international relations that the whole project promised.
1107 These lunches were also convenient occasions for the speakers to
1108 pooh-pooh the claims of the rival tunnel scheme of Lord Richard
1109 Grosvenor's Channel Tunnel Company, which was still being put forward,
1110 although entirely on paper, and to make announcements of miscellaneous
1111 items of news about progress in the Lower Chalk.
1112 
1113 Thus, at one of these lunches at the Lord Warden Hotel held in the
1114 third week of February, 1882, Mr. Myles Fenton, the general manager
1115 of the South-Eastern Railway, took occasion to announce to a large
1116 party of visitors from London that boring of the gallery had now
1117 reached a distance of eleven hundred yards, or nearly two-thirds of
1118 a mile, in the direction of the end of the great Admiralty Pier at
1119 Dover. According to an account in the _Times_, Mr. Fenton read to the
1120 interested gathering a telegram he had received from Sir Edward, who
1121 was unable to be present, but who by wire "expressed the hope that by
1122 Easter Week a locomotive compressed air engine would be running in the
1123 tunnel, of which it was expected the first mile would by that time have
1124 been made. (Cheers.)"
1125 
1126 Sometimes these lunches were held down in the tunnel itself, and
1127 general conditions down there were such that even ladies attended them,
1128 on special occasions, as a contemporary magazine account of a visit
1129 paid to the gallery by a number of engineers with their families makes
1130 clear.
1131 
1132  The visitors were conducted twenty at a time to the end on a sort of
1133  trolley or benches on wheels drawn by a couple of men. In the centre
1134  of the tunnel a kind of saloon, decorated with flowers and evergreens,
1135  was arranged, and, on a large table, glasses and biscuits, etc., were
1136  spread for the inevitable luncheon. There was no infiltration of water
1137  in any part. In the places where several small fissures and slight
1138  oozings had appeared during the boring operations, a shield in sheet
1139  iron had been applied against the wall by the engineer, following all
1140  the circumference of the gallery and making it completely watertight.
1141  There they were as in a drawing-room, and the ladies having descended
1142  in all the glories of silks and lace and feathers were astonished to
1143  find themselves as immaculate on their return as at the beginning
1144  of their trip. The atmosphere in the tunnel was not less pure, but
1145  even fresher than outside, thanks to the compressed air machine
1146  which, having acted on the excavator at the beginning of the cutting,
1147  released its cooled air in the centre of the tunnel.
1148 
1149 With the widespread talk of champagne under the sea, potted plants
1150 flourishing under the electric lights, and bracing breezes blowing
1151 within the Lower Chalk, going down from London to attend one of Sir
1152 Edward's tunnel parties seems to have become one of the fashionable
1153 things to do in English society in the early part of 1882. By
1154 the beginning of spring, visitors taken down into the tunnel and
1155 entertained by Sir Edward included such eminent figures as the Lord
1156 Mayor of London, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Prince and
1157 Princess of Wales. To judge by this stage of affairs, the boring of the
1158 tunnel was going on under the most agreeable of auspices.
1159 
1160 Behind all the sociability and the stream of publicity engendered
1161 in the press by the visits of well-known people to the tunnel, the
1162 situation was not quite so promising. While the physical boring was
1163 going ahead smoothly enough in the Lower Chalk, the promotion of the
1164 tunnel as a full-scale project was encountering growing resistance
1165 from within the upper crust of The Establishment. The fact seems to be
1166 that the British Government had never felt altogether easy about the
1167 idea of the Channel tunnel from the start, and although it had never
1168 formally expressed any misgivings about the scheme as a whole, it had
1169 always been careful not to associate itself with the enterprise, and
1170 its attitude toward its progress generally had been one of reluctant
1171 acquiescence. Whatever disquiet people in government felt about the
1172 tunnel project appears to have been expressed in three general
1173 ways—first, in the introduction of caveats of a military nature;
1174 second, in proposals to delay the progress of the scheme on other than
1175 military grounds; and third, in a general, nameless suspicion of the
1176 whole idea. Such reservations had been evident even in 1875, when the
1177 Channel Tunnel Company applied to Parliament for powers to carry out
1178 experimental work at St. Margaret's Bay.
1179 
1180 To exemplify the first kind of reservation put forward, the Board
1181 of Trade, the governmental department under whose surveillance such
1182 commercial schemes came, made a point of insisting that for defense
1183 purposes the Government must retain absolute power to "erect and
1184 maintain such [military] works at the English mouth of the Tunnel as
1185 they may deem expedient," and in case of actual or threatened war to
1186 close the tunnel down. As for the tendency of governmental people
1187 to find other grounds for objection in the project, this could be
1188 exemplified by the delaying action of the Secretary to the Treasury,
1189 when in 1875 it looked as though Parliament were about to take action
1190 on the Channel-tunnel bill. In a memorandum to the Foreign Office, the
1191 Secretary sought to have the tunnel bill laid aside at the last moment
1192 of its consideration before Parliament so that the answers to all sorts
1193 of important jurisdictional questions could be sought—for example, "If
1194 a crime were committed in the Tunnel, by what authority would it be
1195 cognizable?"[1] And as for the third, unnamed kind of objection, Queen
1196 Victoria, who, with her late husband (Prince Albert died in 1861), had
1197 once been so enthusiastic about the idea of a Channel tunnel, simply
1198 changed her mind about the entire business; in February of 1875, the
1199 Queen wrote Disraeli, without elaborating, that "she hopes that the
1200 Government will do nothing to encourage the proposed tunnel under the
1201 Channel which she thinks very objectionable."
1202 
1203 Ever since 1875, all these official doubts and misgivings had continued
1204 to lurk in the background of the Government's dealings with the
1205 Channel-tunnel promoters—especially military misgivings about the
1206 scheme. Apart from putting down the usual bloody insurrections among
1207 native populations while she went about the business of maintaining
1208 her colonial territories, Britain was at peace with the world. As far
1209 as her military relations with the Continent stood, the threats of
1210 Napoleon I to invade the island had not been forgotten, and even in
1211 the reign of Napoleon III there had been occasional alarms about an
1212 invasion, but the country's physical separation from the Continent
1213 tended to make the military tensions existing over there seem rather
1214 comfortingly remote. Britain's home defenses were left on a pretty
1215 easygoing basis, the country's reliance on resistance to armed attack
1216 being placed, in traditional fashion, in the power of the Royal Navy
1217 to control her seas—meaning, for all practical purposes, its ability
1218 to control the Channel. With the Navy and the Channel to protect her
1219 shores, Britain in the seventies and eighties got along at home with
1220 a professional army of only sixty thousand men, as against a standing
1221 army in France of perhaps three-quarters of a million. Seasickness or
1222 no seasickness, the Channel was considered to be a convenient manpower
1223 and tax-money saver. The advantages of the Channel to Victorian
1224 England were perhaps most eloquently expressed by Mr. Gladstone in
1225 the course of an article of his in the _Edinburgh Review_ in 1870 on
1226 England's relationship to the military and political turmoil existing
1227 on the Continent. "Happy England!" he wrote in a brief panegyric
1228 on the Channel. "Happy ... that the wise dispensation of Providence
1229 has cut her off, by that streak of silver sea, which passengers so
1230 often and so justly execrate ... partly from the dangers, absolutely
1231 from the temptations, which attend upon the local neighborhood
1232 of the Continental nations.... Maritime supremacy has become the
1233 proud—perhaps the indefectible—inheritance of England." And Mr.
1234 Gladstone went on, after dwelling upon one of his favorite themes, the
1235 evils of standing armies and the miserable burden of conscription, to
1236 suggest that Englishmen didn't realize just how grateful they ought to
1237 be for the Channel:
1238 
1239  Where the Almighty grants exceptional and peculiar bounties, He
1240  sometimes permits by way of counterpoise an insensibility to their
1241  value. Were there but a slight upward heaving of the crust of the
1242  earth between France and Great Britain, and were dry land thus to be
1243  substituted for a few leagues of sea, then indeed we should begin to
1244  know what we had lost.
1245 
1246 These remarks of Mr. Gladstone's on the Channel appear to have made a
1247 powerful impression on opinion in upper-class England; for many years
1248 after their publication his partly Shakespearean phrase, "the streak
1249 of silver sea"—or a variation of it, "the silver streak"—remained
1250 as a standard term in the vocabulary of Victorian patriotism. Not
1251 surprisingly, considering his views in 1870, the attitude of Mr.
1252 Gladstone in 1881 and 1882, during his term as Prime Minister, toward
1253 the plan of Sir Edward Watkin to undermine those Straits the statesman
1254 had so extolled was an equivocal one.
1255 
1256 Indeed, quite a number of people in and around Whitehall had
1257 considerably stronger reservations about the Channel-tunnel project
1258 than Mr. Gladstone did. These misgivings had to do with fears that a
1259 completed tunnel under the Channel might form a breach in England's
1260 traditional defense system, and in June of 1881 they first came to
1261 public notice in the form of an editorial in the _Times_. Discussing
1262 the Channel-tunnel project, the _Times_, while conceding that "As an
1263 improvement in locomotion, and as a relief to the tender stomachs
1264 of passengers who dread seasickness, the design is excellent," went
1265 on to observe that "from a national [and military] point of view it
1266 must not the less be received with caution." And the paper asked,
1267 "Shall we be as well off and as safe with it as we now are without
1268 it? Will it be possible for us so to guard the English end of the
1269 passage that it can never fall into any other hands than our own?"
1270 The _Times_ frankly doubted it, and questioned whether, if the tunnel
1271 were built, "a force of some thousands of men secretly concentrated
1272 in a [French] Channel port and suddenly landed on the coast of Kent"
1273 might not be able by surprise to seize the English end of the tunnel
1274 and use it as a bridgehead for a general invasion of England. At the
1275 very least, the paper warned, the construction of the tunnel meant
1276 that "a design for the invasion of England and a general plan of the
1277 campaign will be subjects on which every cadet in a German military
1278 school will be invited to display his powers," and it suggested that
1279 in the circumstances the Channel had best be left untunneled. "Nature
1280 is on our side at present," the _Times_ concluded gravely, "and she
1281 will continue so if we will only suffer her. The silver streak is our
1282 safety." The author of a letter to the _Times_ printed in the same
1283 issue declared that the tunnel, if constructed, could be seized by the
1284 French from within as easily as from without, and that "in three hours
1285 a cavalry force might be sent through to seize the approaches at the
1286 English end."
1287 
1288 To all this Sir Edward Watkin replied easily that the tunnel, when
1289 it was finished, could at any time be rendered unusable from the
1290 British end by "a pound of dynamite or a keg of gunpowder." However,
1291 the negative attitude of a journal as influential as the _Times_ was
1292 a setback for the project. As a result, the Government increased
1293 its caution about the tunnel. When, at the end of 1881, Sir Edward
1294 drew up a private bill for presentation during the coming year to
1295 Parliament that would formally grant the South-Eastern full authority
1296 to buy further coastal lands in the Shakespeare Cliff area and to
1297 complete the construction of and to maintain a Channel tunnel (Lord
1298 Richard Grosvenor and the proprietors of the London, Chatham & Dover
1299 Railway came up with a similar bill on behalf of the Channel Tunnel
1300 Company), the Board of Trade held departmental hearings on the rival
1301 schemes, and at these hearings further attention was turned to the
1302 question of the military security of the tunnel in the event of its
1303 being attacked. At these proceedings, Sir Edward, who appeared for the
1304 purpose of testifying to the civilizing magnificence of his project,
1305 was put somewhat on the defensive by questions about the desirability
1306 of the tunnel from a military point of view. He found himself in
1307 the disconcerting position of being obliged to show not so much the
1308 practicability of building a Channel tunnel as the practicability of
1309 disabling or destroying it. However, making the most of the situation,
1310 he declared that fortifying the English end of the tunnel, and knocking
1311 it out of commission in case of hostile action by another power, was
1312 a simple enough matter to be accomplished in any number of ways—by
1313 flooding it, by filling it with steam, by bringing it under the gunfire
1314 of the Dover fortifications, by exploding electrically operated mines
1315 laid in it, or choking it with shingle dumped in from the outside.
1316 (There was even mention, at the hearings, of a proposal to pour
1317 "boiling petroleum" down upon invaders.) Getting into the spirit of
1318 the thing in spite of himself, Sir Edward told the examining committee
1319 confidently, "I will give you the choice of blowing up, drowning,
1320 scalding, closing up, suffocating and other means of destroying our
1321 enemies.... You may touch a button at the Horse Guards and blow the
1322 whole thing to pieces."
1323 
1324 Notwithstanding Sir Edward's categorical assurances, the wisdom of
1325 constructing the tunnel came under vigorous attack at the hearings from
1326 a formidably high official military source—from Lieutenant-General Sir
1327 Garnet Wolseley, the Adjutant General of the British Army. A veteran
1328 of the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny who was considered to be an
1329 expert on the art of surprise attack—his routing of such foes as
1330 King Koffee in the first Ashanti War of 1873-74, as well as the great
1331 promptitude with which he was said to have "restored the situation" in
1332 the Zulu War, made him a well-known figure to the British public—Sir
1333 Garnet Wolseley had a dual reputation as an imperialist general and
1334 a soldier with advanced ideas on reform of the supply system of the
1335 British Army. In fact, his enthusiasm for efficiency was such that
1336 the phrase "All Sir Garnet" was commonly used in the Army as a way of
1337 saying "all correct." The actor George Grossmith made himself up as
1338 Wolseley to sing the part of "a modern Major-General" in performances
1339 in the eighties of Gilbert and Sullivan's _The Pirates of Penzance_.
1340 Sir Garnet later became Lord Wolseley and Commander-in-Chief of the
1341 British Army. Sir Garnet Wolseley's opinions of the tunnel project
1342 were very strong ones. In a long memorandum he submitted to the Board
1343 of Trade committee examining the tunnel project, he described the
1344 Channel as "a great wet ditch" for the protection of England, the like
1345 of which, he said, no Continental power, if it possessed one instead
1346 of a land frontier, would "cast recklessly away, by allowing it to be
1347 tunnelled under." And he denounced the construction of a Channel tunnel
1348 on the ground that it would be certain to create what he termed "a
1349 constant inducement to the unscrupulous foreigner to make war upon
1350 us." In agitated language, General Wolseley invoked the opinion of the
1351 late Duke of Wellington that England could be invaded successfully,
1352 and he reiterated the fear previously expressed by the _Times_ that
1353 the English end of the tunnel might be seized from the outside—before
1354 any of its defenders had a chance of setting in motion the mechanisms
1355 for blocking it up—by a hostile force landing nearby on British soil,
1356 whereupon it could readily be converted into a bridgehead for a general
1357 invasion of the country. He also declared that "the works at our end
1358 of the tunnel may be surprised by men sent through the tunnel itself,
1359 without landing a man upon our shores." General Wolseley went on to
1360 show just how the deed could be done:
1361 
1362  A couple of thousand armed men might easily come through the tunnel in
1363  a train at night, avoiding all suspicion by being dressed as ordinary
1364  passengers, and the first thing we should know of it would be by
1365  finding the fort at our end of the tunnel, together with its telegraph
1366  office, and all the electrical arrangements, wires, batteries, etc.,
1367  intended for the destruction of the tunnel, in the hands of an enemy.
1368  We know that ... trains could be safely sent through the tunnel every
1369  five minutes, and do the entire distance from the station at Calais
1370  to that at Dover in less than half an hour. Twenty thousand infantry
1371  could thus be easily despatched in 20 trains and allowing ... 12
1372  minutes interval between each train, that force could be poured into
1373  Dover in four hours.... The invasion of England could not be attempted
1374  by 5,000 men, but half that number, ably led by a daring, dashing
1375  young commander might, I feel, some dark night, easily make themselves
1376  masters of the works at our end of the tunnel, and then England would
1377  be at the mercy of the invader.
1378 
1379 General Wolseley conceded that an attack from within the tunnel
1380 itself would be difficult if even a hundred riflemen at the English
1381 end had previously been alerted to the presence of the attackers, but
1382 he doubted that the vigilance of the defenders could always maintain
1383 itself at the necessary pitch. And he put it to the committee: "Since
1384 the day when David secured an entrance by surprise or treachery into
1385 Jerusalem through a tunnel under its walls, how often have places
1386 similarly fallen? and, I may add, will again similarly fall?" General
1387 Wolseley also found highly questionable the efficacy of the various
1388 measures proposed for the protection of the tunnel. He declared that
1389 "a hundred accidents" could easily render such measures useless. Thus,
1390 for example, he found fault with proposals to lay electrically operated
1391 mines inside the tunnel ("A galvanic battery is easily put out of
1392 order; something may be wrong with it just when it is required ... the
1393 gunpowder may be damp"); proposals to admit the sea into the tunnel by
1394 explosion ("an uncertain means of defense"); and proposals to flood
1395 it by sluice-gates at the English end ("These water conduits [might]
1396 become choked or unserviceable when required" and the "drains rendered
1397 useless by treachery"). Then, after pointing out all the frailties of
1398 the contemplated defenses, General Wolseley went on to assert that
1399 the construction of the tunnel would necessitate, at very least, the
1400 conversion of Dover at enormous expense into a first-class fortress and
1401 that it could very well make necessary the introduction into England on
1402 a permanent basis of compulsory military service to meet the increased
1403 threat to Britain's national security.
1404 
1405  Surely [Sir Garnet concluded] John Bull will not endanger his
1406  birth-right, his property, in fact all that man can hold most dear
1407  ... simply in order that men and women may cross to and fro between
1408  England and France without running the risk of seasickness.
1409 
1410 Sir Garnet reinforced the arguments against the tunnel in personal
1411 testimony before the committee. In this testimony he emphasized, among
1412 other things, his conviction that once an enemy got a foothold at
1413 Dover, England would find herself utterly unable "short of the direct
1414 interposition of God Almighty"—an eventuality that Sir Garnet did not
1415 appear to count on very heavily—to raise an army capable of resisting
1416 the invaders. And the inevitable result of such a default, Sir Garnet
1417 told the committee, would be that England "would then cease to exist as
1418 a nation."
1419 
1420 Sir Garnet's fears for Britain were not shared in a memorandum
1421 submitted to the committee by another high Army officer,
1422 Lieutenant-General Sir John Adye, the Surveyor-General of the Ordnance.
1423 Sir John gave his opinion that "a General in France, having the
1424 intention of invading England, would not, in my opinion, count on the
1425 tunnel as adding to his resources." He maintained that the argument
1426 that the English end of the tunnel might be taken from within could
1427 be safely dismissed, as invading troops could be destroyed as they
1428 arrived "by means of a small force, with a gun or two, at the mouth
1429 of the tunnel." As for the possibility of a hostile force landing on
1430 British soil to seize the mouth of the tunnel, he questioned whether
1431 "an enemy, having successfully invaded England, [should] turn aside to
1432 capture a very doubtful line of communication, when the main object
1433 of his efforts was straight before him." General Adye thought that
1434 the invaders "would probably feel a much stronger disposition to march
1435 straight on London and finish the campaign."
1436 
1437 However, the frontal attack on the project by General Wolseley was
1438 not a factor to be discounted by any means. Rallying to it in typical
1439 fashion, Sir Edward Watkin attempted to stifle the spread of patriotic
1440 fears about the tunnel by giving more large lunches at the Lord Warden
1441 Hotel at Dover, and he tried to keep all prospects bright by inviting
1442 more and more prominent people down into the tunnel at Shakespeare
1443 Cliff to marvel at the workings and to refresh themselves with
1444 champagne under the electric lights. By mid-February, his guests in the
1445 tunnel included no less than sixty Members of Parliament whose support
1446 he hoped to obtain for his pending Tunnel Bill, and on one occasion he
1447 even succeeded in having the Prime Minister, Mr. Gladstone himself,
1448 come down into the tunnel and be shown around. Sir Edward assured
1449 his stockholders that what he called "alarmist views" concerning the
1450 construction of the tunnel were without any real foundation. Addressing
1451 an extraordinary general meeting of the Submarine Continental Railway
1452 Company, Sir Edward quoted from an alleged reaction of Count von Moltke
1453 on the matter: "The invasion of England through the proposed tunnel I
1454 consider impossible. You might as well talk of invading her through
1455 that door"—pointing to the entrance to his library. Sir Edward brushed
1456 the arguments of military men aside as a collection of "hobgoblin
1457 arguments" by "men who would prefer to see England remain an island for
1458 ever, forgetting that steam had abolished islands, just as telegraphy
1459 had abolished isolated thought." He insisted that the tunnel promoters
1460 were engaged in a project at once idealistic and practical, and bravely
1461 declared their motto to be identical to that of the South-Eastern
1462 Railway Company—"Onwards."
1463 
1464 By way of countering Sir Garnet Wolseley's invocation of the opinion
1465 of the Duke of Wellington on the dangers of invasion, the promoters
1466 put it about that the Duke of Wellington in his day had strongly
1467 opposed the construction of a railway between Portsmouth and London
1468 on the ground that it would dangerously facilitate the movement of a
1469 French army upon London. They asserted that one unnamed but very high
1470 English military figure had even expressed alarm, at the time of the
1471 Universal Exhibition of 1851, that the English Cabinet did not insist
1472 on the Queen's retiring to Osborne, her country place on the Isle of
1473 Wight, because of the large numbers of foreigners at the Exhibition,
1474 including three thousand men of the French National Guard, who were
1475 allowed to parade the streets of London in uniform, wearing their side
1476 arms. And pro-tunnelers recalled in derisive fashion Lord Palmerston's
1477 denunciation of the Suez Canal project as "a madcap scheme which would
1478 be the ruin of our Indian Empire, were it possible of construction,
1479 and which would spell disaster to those who had the temerity to assert
1480 it." Colonel Beaumont, as an engineer and military man, too, wrote an
1481 article challenging the validity of General Wolseley's conclusions
1482 about the tunnel. Colonel Beaumont maintained that Dover might already
1483 be regarded as "a first-class fortress, quite safe from any _coup de
1484 main_ from without." Concerning an attack by bodies of infantry or
1485 cavalry through the tunnel, he declared, "They cannot come by train;
1486 as, irrespective of any suspicions on the part of the booking clerks,
1487 special train arrangements would have to be made to carry [them]; they
1488 cannot march, as they would be run over by the trains, running, as they
1489 would do, at intervals of ten minutes, or oftener, without cessation,
1490 day or night." Colonel Beaumont also outlined, in his article, a number
1491 of precautionary measures that could be taken to secure the safety
1492 of the English end of the tunnel. They included a system of pumping
1493 coal smoke instead of compressed air from a ventilating shaft into the
1494 tunnel, and also the provision of a system of iron water mains that
1495 would connect the sea with the ventilating shaft and make it possible
1496 for the officer of the guard, in case of invasion, to flood the tunnel
1497 by turning a stopcock. In accordance with these proposed measures,
1498 Sir Edward, early in 1882, attempted to forestall further military
1499 criticism of the Channel-tunnel scheme by having such a ventilating
1500 shaft sunk at the eastern end of Shakespeare Cliff, about a mile from
1501 the main shaft, and having a start made on another horizontal gallery
1502 bored from the foot of the new shaft in the direction of the main pilot
1503 tunnel under the sea. The new gallery was four feet instead of seven
1504 feet in diameter—the smaller aperture in itself being an additional
1505 measure of protection, Sir Edward explained, in that intruders would
1506 find it impossible to walk along the ventilation shaft in an upright
1507 position or in any numbers. A friendly article on the tunnel in the
1508 _Illustrated London News_ at the beginning of March noted significantly
1509 that not only the entrance at the English end—either at Abbots Cliff
1510 or at Sir Edward's proposed glassed-in railway station at Shakespeare
1511 Cliff—would be under the fire of the eighty-ton turret guns installed
1512 on the Admiralty Pier, but that "it is to be observed how completely
1513 [the entrance to the new ventilating shaft] is commanded both from
1514 the sea and from the Pier, and also from the guns of the fortress."
1515 The _Illustrated London News_ obligingly showed the principle of
1516 the thing by running a large two-page-wide engraving depicting, in
1517 handsomely apocalyptic style, the hypothetical destruction of the
1518 entire tunnel workings and, presumably, the invaders inside them, amid
1519 great ballooning clouds of smoke from gun batteries everywhere—from
1520 the end of the Admiralty Pier, from points within the Dover land
1521 fortifications, and from the cannonading broadsides of British naval
1522 men-of-war standing offshore. The fate of invaders from floodwaters
1523 was depicted in a more sensational London publication, the _Penny
1524 Illustrated Paper_, which published an engraving a foot and a half
1525 long and a foot high illustrating "Sir Edward Watkin's remedy for the
1526 invasion scare: Drowning the French Pharaoh in the Channel Tunnel."
1527 The engraving showed a cutaway section of the tunnel under the Channel
1528 near the English end and, rising upward at the left, a staired chamber
1529 of rock equipped with sluice-gates and set in the white cliffs. In
1530 this chamber, two figures in top hats and frock coats are standing and
1531 gazing down on the tunnel, which is filled with French infantry led by
1532 plumed, helmeted officers on horseback. One of the figures in the cliff
1533 chamber, evidently meant to represent Sir Edward Watkin, is in the act
1534 of calmly operating a turncock that has loosed, through the sluices, a
1535 dreadful flood cascading down into the tunnel upon the invaders, who
1536 are turning to flee in panic.
1537 
1538 Vivid as these scenes of destruction were, they had little effect on
1539 the anti-tunnel forces. Already, in February, another attack on the
1540 tunnel scheme had appeared in the literary magazine _The Nineteenth
1541 Century_, signed by Lord Dunsany. The article, repeating the claim
1542 that the tunnel project was a menace to Britain's security, referred
1543 to the capacity of the Dover fortress system to defend itself against
1544 a modern invading fleet as "contemptible." Lord Dunsany wrote that he
1545 had gone down to Dover to examine the famous fortress and had found
1546 that with the exception of the two recently installed turret guns on
1547 the Admiralty Pier, the guns "generally speaking were of an obsolete
1548 pattern—popguns, in fact." And he asserted that when he had remarked
1549 on the relatively modern appearance of one of the larger guns in a
1550 particularly commanding position of the fortress, "I was told by an
1551 artilleryman that there were orders against firing it, as it would
1552 bring down the brickwork of the rampart."
1553 
1554 Soon after this, an anonymous article in the _Army and Navy Gazette_
1555 declared that "The Island has been invaded again and again" and it
1556 reminded the _Gazette's_ readers that "The present constitution of
1557 the country depends on the last successful invasion by a Dutch Prince
1558 with Dutch troops, and the overthrow of the King, by an army largely
1559 composed of foreigners." The article took Lieutenant-General Sir John
1560 Adye severely to task for having found the tunnel a good security risk,
1561 and it even went so far afield in its criticism of him as to find fault
1562 with the General for what it called his "deliberate, vehement, and
1563 long-continued resistance to the introduction of the breech-loading
1564 system in our artillery that placed us at the fag-end of all the world,
1565 when we ought to have been first."
1566 
1567 Then, in March, 1882, _The Nineteenth Century_ carried an article
1568 against the tunnel by Professor Goldwin Smith, who wrote that the
1569 protection of the Channel, by exempting England from the necessity of
1570 keeping a large standing army, had preserved the country from military
1571 despotism and enabled her to move steadily in the path of political
1572 progress. The Channel, Professor Smith wrote, in the past had preserved
1573 England from the Armada and from the army of Napoleon I; in the
1574 sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it had preserved the Reformation;
1575 and in the eighteenth century it had preserved her from the spread
1576 of revolutionary fevers and from subjection to foreign tyranny. Now,
1577 he said, it was the barrier between Britain's industrial people and
1578 military conscription, and he went on, in an echo of Mr. Gladstone's
1579 earlier remarks in the _Edinburgh Review_, to declare of the Channel
1580 that "A convulsion of nature which should dry it up would be almost
1581 as fatal to England as one which should ruin the dykes would be to
1582 Holland."
1583 
1584 Under these circumstances of increasing controversy, the attitude of
1585 the Board of Trade toward the tunnel project became one of further
1586 reserve. In February, the Board informed the War Office that the
1587 military question of the tunnel had assumed such magnitude that a
1588 decision on it should be taken not on a departmental level but on the
1589 higher governmental policy level, and it suggested that the War Office
1590 start its own investigations on the military aspect of the matter.
1591 
1592 Commenting on the prevailing French attitude toward British fears about
1593 the tunnel project, the Paris correspondent of the London _Times_
1594 observed mildly that "the political uneasiness which the scheme
1595 has raised on the other side does not exist here.... No Frenchman,
1596 of course, regards it as jeopardizing national security. Frenchmen
1597 see in it a greater facility for visiting the United Kingdom, and
1598 for relieving the monotony of Swiss tours by a trip to the Scotch
1599 highlands."
1600 
1601 In satirical fashion, a paragraph in _Punch_ undertook to summarize the
1602 reaction in another European country:
1603 
1604  Bogie! The Italian Government are so struck by the alarm exhibited
1605  by Sir Garnet Wolseley at the prospect of a Channel Tunnel, that
1606  they have closed the Mount Cenis and St. Gotthard Tunnels, and left
1607  travellers to the mountain diligences. Their reason for doing this
1608  is the fact that Napoleon really crossed the Alps, while he only
1609  threatened to invade England.
1610 
1611 As for reactions in Germany, the British chargé d'affaires in Dresden
1612 reported in a dispatch to the Foreign Office that he had questioned
1613 the Chief of Staff of the 12th (Saxon) Corps—"an officer of high
1614 attainments"—on his attitude toward the possible invasion of England
1615 through the Channel tunnel, or through sudden seizure of the English
1616 end from the outside.
1617 
1618 He wrote that General von Holleben, the officer in question, had
1619 observed, in connection with the practicability of landing a
1620 Continental force and taking the British end, that although such an
1621 operation was not impossible, "that [it] would succeed in the face of
1622 our military and moral resources, railways and telegraphs, he should
1623 believe when he saw it happen."
1624 
1625  General von Holleben then remarked that the idea of moving an
1626  Army-Corps 25 miles beneath the sea was one which he did not quite
1627  take in. The distance was a heavy day's march; halts must be made; and
1628  the column of troops would be from eight to ten miles long. He was
1629  unable to realize all this off hand, and he did not know but what we
1630  were talking of a chimoera.
1631 
1632  I observed that no one appeared to have asked what would happen to the
1633  air of the tunnel if bodies of 20,000 or even 10,000 men were to move
1634  through at once. The General said that this atmospheric difficulty was
1635  new to him, and it did not sound very soluble.
1636 
1637 But the fears of the War Office were not stilled by such observations
1638 as these. On February 23, the War Office announced that it was
1639 appointing a Channel Tunnel Defense Committee, headed by Major-General
1640 Sir Archibald Alison, the chief of British Army Intelligence,
1641 to collect and examine in detail scientific evidence on "the
1642 practicability of closing effectually a submarine railway tunnel" in
1643 case of actual or apprehended war.
1644 
1645 The Board of Trade, in the meantime, did its best to hold Sir Edward
1646 Watkin and his project off at arm's length. On March 6, 1882, the
1647 secretary of the Board of Trade, which had been keeping an eye on
1648 newspaper accounts of the progress of the tunnel, wrote to remind Sir
1649 Edward of the vital fact that all the foreshore of the United Kingdom
1650 below high-water mark at Dover was "_prima facie_ the property of the
1651 Crown and under the management of the Board of Trade," and that while
1652 the department did not wish to impede progress it distinctly wished to
1653 give notice that the Government "hold themselves free to use any powers
1654 at their disposal in such a matter as Parliament may decide, or as the
1655 general interest of the country may seem to them to require." In other
1656 words, the Board told the Submarine Continental Railway Company that it
1657 could not drive its tunnel toward France without trespassing on Crown
1658 property extending all the way from high-water mark to the three-mile
1659 limit of British jurisdiction—the traditionally accepted limit of the
1660 carrying power of cannon.
1661 
1662 The claim of the Crown to the foreshore in this case was, however, one
1663 that Sir Edward Watkin disputed. He claimed that through an arrangement
1664 with a landowner near Shakespeare Cliff, and by certain purchases
1665 of land from the Archbishop of Canterbury as head of the Church of
1666 England, the tunnel proprietors had come into possession of ancient
1667 manorial rights, originally granted by the Crown itself, that permitted
1668 them to exploit the foreshore at Shakespeare Cliff as they saw fit,
1669 including the right to tunnel under it. Sir Edward had claimed that he
1670 was having made an extensive legal search of the title in question,
1671 which would take a little while.
1672 
1673 But the notification from the Board of Trade was an ominous development
1674 for Sir Edward and his scheme; and even more ominous signs were to
1675 follow. During March, anti-tunneling forces in Britain circulated a
1676 great petition among prominent Englishmen against the scheme, for
1677 presentation to Parliament. The petition, recording the conviction of
1678 the signatories that a Channel tunnel "would involve this country
1679 in military dangers and liabilities from which, as an island, it has
1680 hitherto been happily free," was published in the April issue of _The
1681 Nineteenth Century_, and it was signed not only by military people
1682 but by many of the most diversely eminent literary, scientific, and
1683 ecclesiastical men of the day—including Robert Browning, Alfred, Lord
1684 Tennyson, Herbert Spencer, Professor T. H. Huxley, Cardinals Newman
1685 and Manning, and the Archbishop of York—as well as a great cloud of
1686 names from the nobility and the landed gentry. In an eloquent article
1687 accompanying the petition, the editor of _The Nineteenth Century_,
1688 James Knowles, implicitly added the name of William Shakespeare to the
1689 list of anti-tunnel signatories by invoking the John of Gaunt speech
1690 from _Richard II_:
1691 
1692   This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,
1693   This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
1694   This other Eden, demi-Paradise,
1695   This fortress built by Nature for herself
1696   Against infection and the hand of war,
1697   This happy breed of men, this little world,
1698   This precious stone set in the silver sea,
1699   Which serves it in the office of a wall
1700   Or as a moat defensive to a house,
1701   Against the envy of less happier lands....
1702 
1703 The editor went on to declare, more prosaically, that "To hang the
1704 safety of England at some most critical instant upon the correct
1705 working of a tap, or of any mechanical contrivance, is quite beyond the
1706 faith of this generation of Englishmen."
1707 
1708 Almost at the instant that the heavy blow of the petition in _The
1709 Nineteenth Century_ fell upon the tunnel promoters, the Board of Trade
1710 sent down a real thunderbolt upon their heads. On April 1, the Board of
1711 Trade wrote Sir Edward Watkin that, whatever might be the title to the
1712 foreshore at Shakespeare Cliff, there was no doubt as to the title of
1713 the Crown under the bed of the sea below low-water mark and within the
1714 three-mile limit. It informed him that according to the department's
1715 calculations, based on a tracing of the tunnel route previously
1716 obtained from the Submarine Continental Railway Company, the boring
1717 of the tunnel now must necessarily be close to the point of low-water
1718 mark. And, as a consequence, the Board of Trade instructed the company
1719 that, pending the outcome of the Government's deliberations on the
1720 military security of the tunnel, it must suspend its boring operations
1721 forthwith and give the Government assurances to that effect.
1722 
1723 [Footnote 1: An Anglo-French Joint Commission formed to set up
1724 agreements on the jurisdiction of the two countries over the Channel
1725 tunnel in 1876 actually drew up a protocol for a channel-tunnel treaty
1726 between England and France. The Commission agreed to the jurisdiction
1727 of each government ceasing at a point to be marked in the center of the
1728 tunnel and it recommended that the tunnel be regulated by a specially
1729 appointed international body.]

1732 
1733 
1734 [Illustration: Four]
1735 
1736 
1737 All at once, it seems, the entire British press was in an uproar of
1738 criticism against the Channel tunnel and its unfortunate promoters. The
1739 _Sunday Times_ pretty well expressed a common reaction of newspapers
1740 and periodicals to the latest developments when it said, in an
1741 editorial, "We confess to experiencing a feeling of relief on hearing
1742 of the interdiction of [Sir Edward Watkin's] progress" in his "working
1743 day and night to put an end to that insular position which has in past
1744 times more than once proved our sheet anchor of safety. We sincerely
1745 hope that Sir E. Watkin's project will shortly receive its final _coup
1746 de grâce_. No doubt," it added presciently, "he will not yield without
1747 a resolute struggle."
1748 
1749 Some hard things were said in the press about the great tunnel
1750 promoter. He was accused in various publications of "adroit and
1751 unscrupulous lobbying" and of dispensing "profuse hospitality ...
1752 persistent and continuous" in pursuit of his scheme. In the May issue
1753 of _The Nineteenth Century_, which contained a further number of
1754 attacks on the tunnel, Lord Bury reported bitterly on the softening
1755 effect that Sir Edward Watkin's public-relations technique had had on
1756 a friend of his. Asked if he had signed the great petition against
1757 the tunnel, the friend was said to have replied, "No, I have not; I am
1758 strongly against the construction of the Tunnel, and I told Watkin so.
1759 But he gave a party of us, the other day, an excellent luncheon, and
1760 was very civil in showing us everything; so I should not like to do an
1761 unhandsome thing to him by signing the protest."
1762 
1763 An editorialist in a periodical called _All the Year Round_,
1764 which formerly had been put out by Charles Dickens, wrote of the
1765 "extraordinary vigor" with which Sir Edward was pushing his tunnel.
1766 The editorialist dwelt in satirical fashion on the manner in which
1767 prominent persons were "perpetually being whisked down to Dover by
1768 special trains, conducted into vaults in the chalk, made amiable
1769 with lunch and sparkling wines, and whisked back in return specials
1770 to dilate to their friends (and, incidentally, to the public) on the
1771 peculiar charm of Pommery and Greno consumed in a chamber excavated
1772 far under the sea." The writer found Sir Garnet Wolseley's argument,
1773 that the English end of the tunnel could be seized, "on reflection to
1774 be perfectly feasible." He asked, "Can anyone suppose that if such
1775 a government as that which was formed by the Communists were by any
1776 chance ... to rule France, the danger that the temptation to make such
1777 a grand coup as the conquest and plunder of England would be too much
1778 for them would not be a very real and very present one?" And he wound
1779 up by warning "that French troops might checkmate our fleet by simply
1780 walking underneath it, and ... take a revenge for Waterloo, the remote
1781 possibility of which must make every Englishman shudder."
1782 
1783 The probable future effects of the Channel tunnel upon the nervous
1784 systems of Englishmen were the subject of intense speculation in
1785 most of the press, as a matter of fact. Almost without exception,
1786 the prognosis of this hypothetical nervous condition was grave. If,
1787 nowadays, the capacity to maintain extraordinary spiritual fortitude
1788 under conditions of national emergency has come to be regarded almost
1789 as a basic characteristic of the British people, it is a characteristic
1790 that the Victorian British press seemed not to be aware of. Almost
1791 unanimously, the press warned that part of the price of constructing
1792 a tunnel would be the occurrence of wild periodic alarms among the
1793 population. "Perpetual panics and increased military expenditure are
1794 the natural result of such a change as that which will convert us from
1795 an island into a peninsula," an editorial in _John Bull_ declared. The
1796 London _Daily News_ demanded to know whether "anyone who is in the
1797 least acquainted with English character and history" could deny the
1798 country's susceptibility to periodic panics. The _Daily News_ dwelt
1799 apprehensively on the inevitable result of panics arising out of the
1800 construction of a Channel tunnel:
1801 
1802  We should be constantly beginning expensive and elaborate schemes for
1803  strengthening the defences according to the fashionable idea of the
1804  day.... They would be about half carried out by the time the next
1805  panic occurred, and then they would be obsolete.... Now it would be
1806  elaborate fortifications at Dover itself; now a great chain of forts
1807  to hem it in from inland; now the old scheme of the fortification of
1808  London; now the establishment of forts out at sea over the tunnel....
1809  Is it worth while to run the chance...?
1810 
1811 The most diverse arguments were advanced in the press against the
1812 construction of the tunnel. In the May issue of _The Nineteenth
1813 Century_, Major-General Sir E. Hamley raised the question of whether
1814 the French, invading Britain by train through the tunnel, might not
1815 seize some distinguished English people and carry the captives along
1816 on the engine as hostages, so that however thoroughly the officer in
1817 charge of the defensive apparatus at the English end were alerted to
1818 their presence, "still he might well be expected to pause if suddenly
1819 certified that he would be destroying, along with the enemy in the
1820 Tunnel, some highly important Englishmen." Another writer, referring to
1821 the responsibility and possibly also to the character of the officer
1822 in charge of the tunnel defenses, observed thoughtfully that "the
1823 commandant of Dover would carry the key of England in his pocket."
1824 Still another commentator wondered if responsibility for making a
1825 decision to blow up the tunnel might not be too much even for an
1826 English Prime Minister:
1827 
1828  The Premier might think himself justified in destroying twenty
1829  millions of property ... but also, he might not. He might be an
1830  undecided man, or a man expecting defeat by the Opposition, or a man
1831  paralyzed by the knowledge that the tunnel was full of innocent people
1832  whom his order would condemn to instant death, in a form which is at
1833  once most painful and most appalling to the imagination. They would
1834  all be drowned in darkness. The responsibility would be overwhelming
1835  for an individual, and a Cabinet, if dispersed, takes hours to bring
1836  together.
1837 
1838 In his article in _The Nineteenth Century_ Lord Bury, going under
1839 the assumption that a Prime Minister in a period of gravest national
1840 emergency would indeed be able to haul his Cabinet colleagues and
1841 military advisers together in reasonable time to consider having the
1842 tunnel blown up, asked his readers to conjure up the painful scene at
1843 Downing Street:
1844 
1845  Imagine him for a moment sitting in consultation. His military
1846  advisers tell him that the decisive moment has come. "I think,
1847  gentlemen," says the minister, turning to his colleagues, "that we are
1848  all agreed—the Tunnel must be immediately destroyed. Fire the mine!"
1849  "There is one other point," says the officer, "on which I request
1850  instructions—at what time am I to execute the order?" "At once, sir;
1851  telegraph at once, and in five minutes the blasting charge can be
1852  fired." "But," persists the officer, "trains laden with non-combatants
1853  are at this moment in the Tunnel. They enter continuously at twenty
1854  minutes' intervals; there are never less than four trains, two each
1855  way, in the Tunnel at the same time; each train contains some three
1856  hundred persons ... I could not destroy twelve hundred non-combatants
1857  without very special instructions."
1858 
1859 And Lord Bury asked, "What would any minister, under such
1860 circumstances, do?"
1861 
1862 As for the proposed defensive measure of flooding the tunnel in case
1863 of invasion, General Sir Lintorn Simmons, writing in the same issue of
1864 _The Nineteenth Century_, considered it to be a dubious one at best,
1865 since, he observed, "it is not to be believed that a great country like
1866 France, with the engineering talent she possesses, could not find the
1867 means" of pumping all the flood waters out again.
1868 
1869 An assertion by Dr. Siemens, the electric-lighting expert, that the
1870 tunnel could easily be rendered unusable to invaders if its British
1871 defenders would pump carbonic-acid gas into it to asphyxiate the
1872 intruders, was similarly challenged, in the correspondence columns
1873 of the _Times_, by a scientific colleague of his, Dr. John Tyndall.
1874 Dr. Tyndall offered to wager Dr. Siemens that the latter could in six
1875 hours devise countermeasures that would enable troops to pass unscathed
1876 through the tunnel, gas or no gas. Dr. Tyndall illustrated his point
1877 by describing an experiment he said he had made on the very day of his
1878 letter, while coming down home from London by train, on a part of the
1879 South-Eastern line where the speed was thirty miles an hour:
1880 
1881  I took out my watch and determined how long I could hold my breath
1882  without inhalation. By emptying my lungs very thoroughly, and then
1883  charging them very fully, I brought the time up to nearly a minute
1884  and a half. In this interval I might have been urged through more
1885  than half a mile of carbonic-acid gas with no injury and with little
1886  inconvenience to myself.
1887 
1888 Dr. Tyndall concluded, firmly, "The problem of supplying fresh air
1889 to persons surrounded by an irrespirable atmosphere has been already
1890 solved by Mr. Fleuss and others."
1891 
1892 Then there were even more disturbing objections. Could the defenders
1893 at the English end always be relied on as absolutely loyal Englishmen?
1894 _The Field_, without naming any names, wrote of "proof that in the
1895 United Kingdom itself ... there are numbers of daring and reckless
1896 persons" who, "to gain their sinister ends ... would not hesitate
1897 to sacrifice the independence of the country." Frankly, the paper
1898 feared possible acts of treachery in the tunnel by "a handful of
1899 unprincipled desperadoes." And the _Spectator_, visualizing the thing
1900 in more detail, suggested that its readers "consider ... the danger of
1901 treachery ... the rush on the tunnel being made by Irish Republicans in
1902 league with the French, while the wires of the telegraph were cut, and
1903 all swift communications between Dover and London suddenly suspended."
1904 Taking all the risks of the tunnel into account, the _Spectator_ said
1905 it could not bring itself to believe that "even in this age, with its
1906 mania for rapid riding and comfortable locomotion, such a project will
1907 be tolerated." The _Sunday Times_, for its part, pointed out that, as
1908 things stood, "the silver streak is a greater bar to the movements of
1909 Nihilists [and] Internationalists ... than is generally believed."
1910 But, it added, "with several trains a day between Paris and London,
1911 we should have an amount of fraternising between the discontented
1912 denizens of the great cities of both countries, which would yield very
1913 unsatisfactory results on this side of the Channel."
1914 
1915 Meetings and debates to discuss the tunnel menace were held all over
1916 England, and even at a meeting of so progressive an organization as
1917 the Balloon Society of Great Britain, which was held in the lecture
1918 room of the Royal Aquarium at Westminster, the subject was discussed
1919 with "some warmth of feeling ... on both sides." There was a wide
1920 circulation of sensational pamphlets, written in pseudohistorical
1921 style, that purported to chronicle the sudden downfall of England at
1922 the end of the nineteenth century through the existence of a Channel
1923 tunnel—Dover taken, the garrison butchered, the English end of the
1924 tunnel incessantly vomiting forth armed men, London invaded, and
1925 England enslaved—all of this in a few hours' time.
1926 
1927 In contrast to these manifold cries of alarm among the English, it
1928 seems never to have occurred to anybody in France at the time seriously
1929 to suggest that if a tunnel were to be constructed, a hostile English
1930 force, supported by an English navy in control of the Channel sea,
1931 might suddenly seize the French entrance by surprise and use it as a
1932 bridgehead for a general invasion of France. A few French commentators
1933 did, however, remind the anti-tunnel forces in England that while the
1934 English had set hostile foot on French soil some two or three times in
1935 as many centuries—not to mention her having kept physical control
1936 over the port of Calais for over two hundred years following the
1937 Battle of Crécy—English soil had remained untouched by France. Most
1938 of the French newspapers appeared to be unable to fathom the cause of
1939 the whole tunnel commotion, which was generally put down to English
1940 eccentricity. Several French journals, surveying all the fulminations
1941 on the other side of the Channel, even took an attitude toward the
1942 English of a certain detached sympathy. One of the more interesting
1943 French commentaries on the uproar in England appeared in the _Revue
1944 des Deux Mondes_. In this article, the author expressed some doubt
1945 that British military men who denounced the dangers of the tunnel were
1946 really convinced of the reality of those dangers. For them to do so, he
1947 suggested, one would have to presuppose, on one side of the Channel, a
1948 "France again a conqueror with, at her head, a man gifted with ... an
1949 incredible depth in crime; a secret, an almost incredible diligence in
1950 preparation as in execution," and, on the other side, "a governor of
1951 Dover who would be an idiot or a traitor, a War Minister who would not
1952 possess the brain of a bird, a Foreign Minister who would allow himself
1953 to be deceived in doltish fashion." How could the French possibly
1954 assemble perhaps a thousand railway carriages in England without
1955 arousing the suspicions of British Intelligence? How could the vanguard
1956 of the French invaders get through the tunnel with all their required
1957 ammunition, horses, and supplies, and get them all unloaded in a few
1958 minutes—would this vanguard sally forth without biscuits? The author
1959 found no solution to these particular problems. Instead, he devoted
1960 himself to the larger issue:
1961 
1962  The day the inauguration of the Submarine Tunnel will be celebrated,
1963  England will no longer be an island, and that is a stupendous
1964  event in the history of an island people.... Islanders have always
1965  considered themselves the favorites of Providence, which has
1966  undertaken to provide for their security and independence.... They
1967  congratulate themselves on their separation from the rest of the world
1968  by natural frontiers over which nobody can squabble. They feel that
1969  they hold their destiny in their own hands, and that the effect of the
1970  follies and crimes of others could not reach them.... Their character
1971  is affected by this. Like Great Britain, every Englishman is an island
1972  where it is not easy to land.
1973 
1974 And the article asked, wonderingly, "What would an England that was not
1975 an island be?"
1976 
1977 The deliberations of the scientific investigating committee appointed
1978 by the War Office and presided over by Sir Archibald Alison lasted from
1979 the latter part of February until the middle of May. In the committee's
1980 report of its findings to the War Office, the complexity and solemn
1981 nature of the questions laid before it were indicated by their
1982 mere classification and subclassification. Thus, the contingencies
1983 for rendering a Channel tunnel absolutely useless to an enemy were
1984 considered under the headings of:
1985 
1986   I.   Surprise from Within
1987   II.   Attack from Without
1988 
1989 And the committee reported that it had considered measures to secure
1990 the tunnel against (I) under such subcategories as:
1991 
1992   1.   Fortifications
1993   2.   Closure or temporary obstructions
1994   3.   Explosion by mines or charges
1995   4.   Flooding
1996     a.   Temporary
1997     b.   Permanent
1998 
1999 After reviewing the situation in great detail, and from every aspect,
2000 the committee suggested a long list of precautionary measures that,
2001 it said, it would be necessary to use, singly or in combination, to
2002 protect and seal off the tunnel against any enemy attempts to invade
2003 England directly through the tunnel or by seizing the English end
2004 from the outside and using it as a bridgehead for invasion. The list
2005 included these recommendations:
2006 
2007 The mouth of the tunnel should be protected by "a portcullis or other
2008 defensible barrier."
2009 
2010 A trap bridge should be set in connection with this portcullis.
2011 
2012 Means should be provided for closing off the ventilation, and for
2013 "discharging irrespirable gases or vapors into the tunnel."
2014 
2015 Arrangements should be made for rapidly discharging loads of shingle
2016 into the land portion of the tunnel, shutting it off.
2017 
2018 The land portion of the tunnel should be thoroughly mined with
2019 explosives capable of being fired by remote control exercised not only
2020 from within the central fort at Dover but also from more distant points
2021 inland, so that even if the protective fortress fell to the enemy, the
2022 tunnel still could be permanently destroyed.
2023 
2024 In addition, a truck loaded with explosives and equipped with a time
2025 fuse should be kept ready by the entrance, so that it could be sent
2026 coasting down into the tunnel for some distance, there to explode
2027 automatically.
2028 
2029 Arrangements should be made for temporarily flooding the tunnel by
2030 means of culverts operated by sluice valves. ("If by chance the sluice
2031 valves should not act, Measure XVIII could be resorted to, or the
2032 tunnel could be blocked by one or more of the means ... mentioned in
2033 Measures VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII.")
2034 
2035 The tunnel should emerge inland, out of firing range from the sea. And
2036 it was imperative that it emerge under the guns and "in the immediate
2037 vicinity of a first-class fortress, in the modern acceptation of the
2038 term, a fortress which could only be reduced after a protracted siege
2039 both by land and sea."
2040 
2041 And so on.
2042 
2043 Even after drawing up all these elaborate precautions for closing the
2044 tunnel from the English end, the Channel Tunnel Defense Committee was
2045 left with some nagging doubts about their adequacy. In a concluding
2046 paragraph of its report, the committee pointed out that "it must always
2047 be borne in mind that, in dealing with physical agencies, an amount of
2048 uncertainty exists," and that it was "impossible to eliminate human
2049 fallibility." As a consequence, the members stated cautiously, "it
2050 would be presumptuous to place absolute reliance upon even the most
2051 comprehensive and complete arrangements."
2052 
2053 The committee also agreed, almost as an afterthought, that the Channel
2054 tunnel proposed by Sir Edward Watkin could not be sanctioned in the
2055 form envisaged, on the grounds that it did not meet the committee's
2056 conditions for emerging inland, out of firing range from the sea, and
2057 in the immediate vicinity of a first-class fortress. It also rejected,
2058 on the first of these grounds, a proposal by the lesser Channel Tunnel
2059 Company for a tunnel that would start from within Dover and for the
2060 sake of easy destructibility run right under a nearby corner of Dover
2061 Castle—and on the grounds that this entrance would be _too_ much in
2062 the vicinity of a fortress. And the committee objected that since the
2063 proposed entrance would emerge "in the heart of the main defences and
2064 in the midst of the town" any fire from these defenses "would inflict
2065 great injury on the town and its inhabitants, and the general defence
2066 would be much embarrassed."
2067 
2068 At the War Office, the report of the Alison committee was supplemented
2069 by another long memorandum on the tunnel question by Sir Garnet
2070 Wolseley. In this document of some twenty thousand words, which
2071 was conveniently furnished with numerous marginal headings like
2072 "Why tunnels through the Alps afford no argument in favor of the
2073 Channel Tunnel," "The Tunnel an acknowledged danger," "What national
2074 advantage then justifies its construction," "Many tunnels will be
2075 constructed," "What we owe to the Channel," and "Danger of surprise
2076 of our fortifications without warning! Fatal result!!," Sir Garnet
2077 recapitulated and elaborated at great length upon his previous
2078 arguments against the tunnel and added several new ones. Sir Garnet
2079 went into fine detail concerning the possibility of a sudden seizure
2080 of the English end of the tunnel and, simultaneously, Dover, by the
2081 French. For example, to his previous description of how hostile
2082 French forces might come by train through the tunnel dressed in
2083 ordinary clothes he added the detail that they might also travel
2084 in the carriages "at express speed, with the blinds down, in their
2085 uniforms and fully armed"—their co-conspirators at the other end
2086 meanwhile having rendered it "not likely that ticket-takers or
2087 telegraph operators on the French side would be allowed any channel
2088 of communicating with us until the operation had been effected." Sir
2089 Garnet was equally explicit about the situation at Dover. Warning that
2090 "the civilian may start in horror at the statement that Dover could
2091 also be taken by surprise," General Wolseley declared that, as things
2092 stood, anybody at all, any night, was free to walk up to any of the
2093 forts at Dover, and, "if he would announce himself to be an officer
2094 returning home to barracks, the wicket would be opened to him, and
2095 if he entered he would see but two men, one the sentry, the other
2096 the noncommissioned officer who had been roused up from sleep by the
2097 sentry to unlock the gate." General Wolseley demonstrated how such a
2098 caller might well be "a dashing partisan leader" of a French raiding
2099 party that had landed in Dover in the dead of night, in calm or foggy
2100 weather, from steamers, and had already quietly knocked down and
2101 silenced any watchman or other witnesses in the dark area. He showed
2102 how such a _soi-disant_ English officer and his accomplices "might thus
2103 easily obtain an entrance into every fort in Dover; the sentry and the
2104 sleepy sergeant might be easily disposed of. The rifles of our sentries
2105 at home are not loaded, and the few men on guard [could be] made
2106 prisoners whilst asleep on their guard bed." Thus, General Wolseley
2107 said, the intruders could quickly effect the seizure of all the forts
2108 in Dover—"In an hour's time from the moment when our end of the tunnel
2109 was taken possession of by the enemy, large reinforcements could reach
2110 Dover through the tunnel, and ... before morning dawned, Dover might
2111 easily be in possession of 20,000 of the enemy, and every succeeding
2112 hour would add to that number." With Dover done in, London would be
2113 next, and the future commander-in-chief of the British Army went on to
2114 show how the enemy force, now swelled to 150,000 men, once it reached
2115 London and occupied the Thames from there to the arsenal at Woolwich,
2116 could dictate its own terms of peace, which he estimated at a rough
2117 guess as the payment of six hundred million pounds and the surrender
2118 of the British Fleet, with the English end of the tunnel remaining
2119 permanently in the hands of the French, so that "the perpetual yoke of
2120 servitude would be ours for ever."
2121 
2122 Concerning all the various measures proposed to protect the tunnel,
2123 Sir Garnet had no confidence in them at all. He stressed once more
2124 the unreliability of anything mechanical or electrical, and he added
2125 the new argument that whatever secret devices, such as mines, were
2126 installed in the tunnel for its protection were bound to come to the
2127 knowledge of the enemy sooner or later. Any military secret, General
2128 Wolseley said, was a purchasable secret; he illustrated his argument
2129 with an observation concerning a meeting between Napoleon I and
2130 Alexander I of Russia:
2131 
2132  No two men were more loyally followed or had more absolute authority
2133  than Napoleon and Alexander. No two men had a stronger wish or
2134  stronger motive for keeping secret the words which passed between them
2135  personally in a most private conference in a raft in the middle of
2136  a river. Yet, by paying a large sum our Ministry obtained the exact
2137  terms of the secret agreement the two had there arrived at. Moreover,
2138  our Ministry obtained that information so immediately that they were
2139  able to act in anticipation of the designs formed by the two Emperors.
2140 
2141 Finally, having discussed, in the most elaborate fashion, all the
2142 measures that his previous opposition to the scheme had caused to be
2143 proposed for the defense of the tunnel, Sir Garnet condemned them
2144 on the ground of their very elaborateness. "If in any one of these
2145 respects our security fails, it fails in all," he wrote of the multiple
2146 precautions recommended by Sir Archibald Alison's scientific committee.
2147 Thus, in General Wolseley's eyes, the defense of the tunnel was
2148 foredoomed as a self-defeating process, and was therefore a practical
2149 impossibility.
2150 
2151 The question of the multiplicity of the proposed defenses was handled
2152 in different fashion in a further War Office memorandum on the tunnel,
2153 issued by the Duke of Cambridge, the Army Commander-in-Chief and a
2154 cousin of Queen Victoria. "Nothing has impressed me more with the
2155 magnitude of the danger which the construction of this proposed tunnel
2156 would bring with it," the Duke of Cambridge wrote, "than the amount
2157 of precautions and their elaborateness [proposed by] this Scientific
2158 Committee.... If this danger was small, as some would have the country
2159 believe, why should all these complicated precautions be necessary?"
2160 The Duke of Cambridge fully endorsed the position taken by Sir Garnet
2161 Wolseley. He protested "most emphatically" against the construction
2162 of a Channel tunnel and "would most earnestly beg Her Majesty's
2163 Government" to consider with the utmost gravity the perils of surprise
2164 attack upon the country arising out of even a modified scheme that
2165 would take into account the recommendations of the Alison committee.
2166 
2167 To his memorandum His Royal Highness appended a copy of a report
2168 that he had had his intelligence service put together specially in
2169 connection with the tunnel question—a long account purporting to
2170 show some hundred and seven instances occurring in the history of
2171 the previous two hundred years where hostilities between states had
2172 been started without any prior declaration of war, or even any decent
2173 notification.
2174 
2175 If anything seemed likely to have been successfully blocked up and
2176 finished off under all this bombardment, it was Sir Edward Watkin's
2177 Channel-tunnel scheme. Curiously enough, the Board of Trade, which
2178 had ordered the tunnel workings stopped back in April and had no
2179 intention of issuing a working permit for them now, was not altogether
2180 convinced of this. In fact, since April the Board had been developing
2181 the suspicion that something peculiar might be going on down under the
2182 sea at Shakespeare Cliff. Back in the early part of April, the Board
2183 of Trade's order to the Submarine Continental Railway Company to stop
2184 its tunneling activities was received, as one might expect, with some
2185 anguish. The first formal reaction was a letter from the permanent
2186 secretary of the company to T. H. Farrer, the secretary of the Board
2187 of Trade, saying that the company would of course acquiesce in the
2188 orders of the board, but begging, at the same time, to be allowed to
2189 continue the present gallery extending from the main, or Number Two,
2190 shaft at Shakespeare Cliff a short distance further, so as to be able
2191 to complete the first stage of the works—the junction of the main
2192 gallery with the new gallery extending from the ventilating, or Number
2193 Three, shaft. This letter was followed on April 9 by another from Sir
2194 Edward Watkin addressed to Joseph Chamberlain, the president of the
2195 Board of Trade, urgently repeating the request, this time on the ground
2196 of safety. Sir Edward wrote Mr. Chamberlain:
2197 
2198  The moment the Board of the Tunnel Company decided to obey you, I
2199  peremptorily ordered the works to be stopped. The [boring] machine has
2200  been silent since Thursday evening. But the Engineer sends me a very
2201  startling report and warning.
2202 
2203  He fears _defective ventilation_ [owing to stoppage of the air-driven
2204  boring machine] and danger to life—quite apart from depriving a fine
2205  body of skilled workmen of their bread, and general loss and damage
2206  in money. I can only reply to him that I am acting under your order.
2207  Still ... this is the first time the ventilation of a mine has been
2208  so interfered with. Should the engineer's alarm be well founded, and
2209  should men faint from bad air at the end of the gallery, there would
2210  be no means of getting them out alive.
2211 
2212 Sir Edward added, without changing his tone of humane agitation,
2213 that only the day before he had received a request from the Duke of
2214 Edinburgh to be allowed to see the tunnel workings, along with the
2215 Duchess, ten days hence, and that the Speaker of the House of Commons
2216 had already arranged to visit the tunnel "on Saturday, the 22nd,
2217 leaving Charing Cross at eleven." "What must be done?" he asked. Mr.
2218 Chamberlain replied promptly by telegraph that if the stopping of
2219 the machinery in the tunnel was constituting a danger to life, he
2220 authorized Sir Edward, pending further investigation of the situation
2221 by the Board of Trade, temporarily to keep the machinery going to the
2222 extent of preventing this danger. However, he followed up this telegram
2223 with a letter to Sir Edward in which he expressed himself as being "not
2224 able to understand the exact nature of the physical danger anticipated"
2225 by Sir Edward in the tunnel if the workings were stopped. "I do not see
2226 the necessity for workmen remaining in the tunnel where the ventilation
2227 is likely to be defective," Mr. Chamberlain observed. He added that he
2228 was making arrangements to have one of the Board of Trade inspectors
2229 visit the tunnel to investigate the situation.
2230 
2231 On April 11, the Board of Trade duly telegraphed Sir Edward that its
2232 chief inspector of railways, Colonel Yolland, of the Royal Engineers,
2233 would be at Dover at noon the next day to investigate the ventilation
2234 problem in the tunnel. Sir Edward, however, wired back that he was
2235 unable to meet the Colonel at Dover that day and could not make an
2236 appointment with him "until after the visit to the works of the Duke of
2237 Edinburgh on Tuesday next."
2238 
2239 To this the Board of Trade replied, on April 13, that Colonel Yolland
2240 had been instructed to visit the tunnel works "entirely out of regard
2241 to the very urgent and grave question raised in your letter ...
2242 respecting the ventilation of the boring" and that the department was
2243 finding it difficult to understand why Colonel Yolland's visit to
2244 the tunnel should be postponed. Sir Edward's answer to this was to
2245 invite Mr. Chamberlain down into the tunnel personally, so that Sir
2246 Edward could "show and explain everything," since "until you have
2247 seen, and had explained to you, on the spot as Mr. Gladstone did and
2248 had, and as we hope the Duke of Edinburgh will next Tuesday, the
2249 nature and condition of our works, it is, in my humble judgement,
2250 impossible to discuss the question with exactitude." He said nothing
2251 about the possibility of Mr. Chamberlain's or the Duke and Duchess of
2252 Edinburgh's being asphyxiated in the tunnel. Mr. Chamberlain declined
2253 the invitation; he said he had ordered Colonel Yolland down to Dover
2254 immediately to report on the tunnel. But Colonel Yolland didn't get
2255 down into the tunnel to make an inspection that month. Some impediment,
2256 some unanticipated difficulty always seemed to arise when things
2257 appeared to be about to straighten themselves out. By the beginning
2258 of May, the Board of Trade, still trying, flatly informed Sir Edward
2259 that Colonel Yolland and Walter Murton, its solicitor, would inspect
2260 the tunnel workings on May 6. But on May 4 the general manager of the
2261 South-Eastern Railway replied that "Sir Edward Watkin wishes me to say
2262 that he regrets very much that it will be quite impossible to arrange
2263 for such inspection to take place on that date." He suggested that Sir
2264 Edward could arrange it for the 13th. The Board of Trade, replying
2265 immediately, insisted on its taking place "not later than Wednesday
2266 next." That letter was met with the answer that "Sir Edward Watkin
2267 is at present out of town, and is not expected to return until early
2268 next week." He must have stayed out of town quite a while, because the
2269 Board of Trade heard nothing from the company until May 18, when the
2270 directors of the company, writing jointly, told the department that
2271 while they acquiesced in the request of Colonel Yolland and Mr. Murton
2272 to visit the tunnel, unfortunately "the machinery is under repair,"
2273 and as a consequence "it would not be ... safe for those gentlemen
2274 to go down the shaft." However, the directors added, hopefully, they
2275 felt sure that "by working the machinery, air compressors, and pumping
2276 engines for a few days and nights" their engineers could get everything
2277 in order for a proper tour of inspection. On May 24 Mr. Murton tried
2278 again. He wrote the tunnel proprietors, notifying them that "Colonel
2279 Yolland and myself propose to inspect the tunnel works on Saturday next
2280 the 27th instant." But the company's reply to the letter was regretful.
2281 It said that "the repairs to the winding engine cannot be completed
2282 until after Whitsuntide."
2283 
2284 Meanwhile, Mr. Murton was having his difficulties with the solicitor
2285 of the South-Eastern over the legal question of the company's claims
2286 to ancient manorial rights to the use of the foreshore at Shakespeare
2287 Cliff, as the tone of various letters he was obliged to write
2288 indicates. For example:
2289 
2290   DEAR SIR,
2291 
2292  May I remind you that I have not yet received the abstract of title; I
2293  beg that you will at once send it to me....
2294 
2295   I am, & c.,
2296   WALTER MURTON
2297 
2298 
2299 Or again:
2300 
2301   DEAR SIR,
2302 
2303  I am without answer to my letter of the 31st ultimo. I beg you will
2304  let me know without further delay whether you do or do not propose to
2305  send me abstract of title.
2306 
2307   I am, & c.,
2308   WALTER MURTON
2309 
2310 
2311 Or yet again:
2312 
2313   DEAR SIR,
2314 
2315  Will you kindly write me a reply to my letters which I can send on to
2316  the Board of Trade.
2317 
2318   Yours, & c.,
2319   WALTER MURTON
2320 
2321 
2322 By June 9, the Board of Trade became quite out of patience over the
2323 matter of inspecting the tunnel. Introducing an ominous note, it
2324 informed Sir Edward that Mr. Chamberlain "feels that he must insist
2325 upon this visit of inspection, and if he understands that permission
2326 is refused, will be compelled to place the matter in the hands of his
2327 legal advisers, with the view of determining and enforcing the rights
2328 of the Crown." Sir Edward was indignant. In reply, he declared that
2329 he was being subjected to an "undeserved threat." Mr. Chamberlain,
2330 responding, denied that the threat was undeserved. He wrote firmly:
2331 
2332  Hitherto, on one ground or another, this inspection has been again and
2333  again postponed.
2334 
2335  I am bound to guard the rights of the Crown in this matter, and I
2336  desire to ascertain whether those rights have up to the present time
2337  been in any way invaded.
2338 
2339  This is the object of the inspection, and as it will not brook delay
2340  ... I have only now to ask an immediate answer stating definitely when
2341  it can take place.
2342 
2343 Sir Edward's answer was once more to beg Mr. Chamberlain himself to
2344 join a party of prominent visitors going down to see the tunnel; he
2345 added that "Colonel Yolland shall be at once communicated with."
2346 
2347 But by various intervening circumstances—joint letters got up by the
2348 tunnel promoters to the Prime Minister and to the Board of Trade
2349 protesting hard treatment, and so on—the Board of Trade found itself
2350 brooking delays all through the month of June. On June 26, the Board
2351 of Trade wrote in stern fashion to Sir Edward that the demands of the
2352 Board of Trade to inspect the tunnel workings "have been repeatedly
2353 formulated and persistently evaded on behalf of the Submarine
2354 Continental Railway Company," and that the only way the company could
2355 avoid legal action by the Crown was "to consent _at once_ to the
2356 proposed inspection." There was no satisfactory reply from the tunnel
2357 proprietors, and on July 5 the Board of Trade, after due notification
2358 to the Submarine Continental Railway Company, obtained an order from
2359 Mr. Justice Kay, in the High Court of Justice, restraining the tunnel
2360 promoters and their employees from "further working or excavating,
2361 or taking or interfering with any chalk, soil, or other substance"
2362 in the Channel tunnel without the consent of the Board of Trade, and
2363 ordering them to give the department access to the tunnel to inspect
2364 the workings. In the course of these judicial proceedings, a number of
2365 affidavits presented to Mr. Justice Kay by the Government revealed the
2366 interesting information that the Board of Trade, finding itself unable
2367 to obtain access for its inspectors into the tunnel, for some time
2368 past had felt itself obliged to station watchers on top of Shakespeare
2369 Cliff and on the sea regularly to spy upon the tunnel workings and
2370 to count the number of bucketfuls of soil it maintained had been
2371 removed from the workings. And, according to all its calculations, the
2372 Board of Trade had little doubt that the proprietors of the Submarine
2373 Continental Railway Company were deliberately and surreptitiously
2374 tunneling under the sea below low-water mark, on Crown property, and
2375 burrowing into and removing chalk of the realm.
2376 
2377 Intimation of what was in store for him in the High Court of Justice
2378 reached Sir Edward Watkin at the very time that he was showing a party
2379 of distinguished people, including Ferdinand de Lesseps, the builder of
2380 the Suez Canal, around the tunnel. A glimpse of that interesting visit
2381 is contained in a report in the London _Times_:
2382 
2383  M. de Lesseps, while down in the tunnel and under the sea, proposed
2384  the health of the Queen, remarking that the completion of the work was
2385  required in the interest of mankind.
2386 
2387  When all the visitors were again above ground, luncheon was served in
2388  a marquee.
2389 
2390  Sir E. Watkin, in proposing the health of M. de Lesseps, remarked
2391  that there were those in our country who seemed to consider that the
2392  work of the company they had just inspected was a crime. He had just
2393  received a telegram informing him that he would have to answer on
2394  Wednesday next at the instigation of the President of the Board of
2395  Trade before a court of law for having committed the crime of carrying
2396  on these experiments. (Hisses and groans.)
2397 
2398 Somewhat revealingly, Sir Edward added, when the signs of indignation
2399 subsided, that
2400 
2401  For his own part, if he was to be committed by a court of law for
2402  contempt, he should have this consolation—that the proceedings
2403  which had been taken against him had been delayed sufficiently long
2404  to enable him with his colleagues to have the honor of entertaining
2405  M. de Lesseps, in whom he should have a witness, if he had to call
2406  one, to prove that they had been engaged in a work which had been as
2407  successful as he believed it would be ultimately useful.
2408 
2409 At long last, supported by all the might of the Crown, Colonel Yolland
2410 got to the tunnel on July 8 to make his inspection of the workings.
2411 But upon his arrival there he found, to his chagrin, that "I was not
2412 provided, at the time ... with all the necessary means for making the
2413 measurements, and taking the requisite bearings" in the tunnel, and he
2414 was obliged to put his inspection off once more. Properly equipped,
2415 he descended into the tunnel a week later, on Saturday, July 15, and
2416 inspected everything, including the boring apparatus that Sir Edward
2417 had insisted had to be used to ventilate the gallery and prevent
2418 loss of life. What Colonel Yolland found there caused the Board of
2419 Trade, five days later, to send a most severe letter to the tunnel
2420 proprietors. In it, the Board declared:
2421 
2422  1. That the means of ventilating the tunnel could have been and be so
2423  readily disconnected from the boring machine (i.e., by the movement
2424  of a single lever that would pour a stream of compressed air coming
2425  from the supply pipe directly into the tunnel) that it has never been
2426  necessary that a single inch of cutting should have taken place in
2427  order to protect life or to secure ventilation, nor can such necessity
2428  arise in the future.
2429 
2430  2. That in spite of the repeated orders of the Board of Trade, and
2431  the assurances of the Secretary of the Submarine Railway Company and
2432  Sir Edward Watkin himself that those orders were acquiesced in and
2433  submitted to, the substantial work of boring has nevertheless been
2434  carried to a distance of more than 600 yards from low-water mark (thus
2435  constituting a trespass on the property of the Crown).
2436 
2437 Calling these acts "a flagrant breach of faith" on the part of the
2438 tunnel promoters, the Board of Trade wrote that henceforth the order
2439 of the court "must be strictly and literally adhered to," and that
2440 no work of maintenance, ventilation, drainage, or otherwise would be
2441 allowed without the express permission of the board. Sir Edward Watkin
2442 and his fellow directors, after some days, replied in hurt fashion to
2443 what they termed "the unjustified accusations directed against them."
2444 They reiterated their concern for the health of their employees in
2445 the tunnel, and in connection with their tunneling activities below
2446 low-water mark they came up with the ingenious explanation that "many
2447 visits of Royal and other personages have been, by request, made to the
2448 tunnel for purposes of inspection, and it was essential fully to work
2449 the machine from time to time for the purpose of such visits." They
2450 also sent a protest to Mr. Gladstone at 10 Downing Street against their
2451 hard treatment, and asked for the Prime Minister's intercession with
2452 the Board of Trade. But there was nothing doing. Mr. Gladstone politely
2453 refused to act and replied that the actions of the Board of Trade had
2454 the full sanction of the Government.
2455 
2456 On August 5, Colonel Yolland descended once more into the tunnel
2457 to make an inspection. He found things there in a rather run-down
2458 condition. "The tunnel is not nearly so dry as it was when I first
2459 saw it," he wrote in his report to the Board of Trade, referring to
2460 the fact that the engineers had ceased work on the drainage of the
2461 gallery. Colonel Yolland also mentioned in his report that during his
2462 previous visit, on July 15, "I had an escape from what might have been
2463 a serious accident. The wet chalk in the bottom of the tunnel, between
2464 and outside the rails of the tramways, is so slippery and greasy that
2465 it is almost impossible to keep on one's feet; and, on one occasion, I
2466 suddenly slipped, and fell at full length on my back, and the back of
2467 my head came against one of the iron rails of the tramway—fortunately
2468 with no great force or my skull might have been seriously bruised or
2469 fractured." The Colonel added, "There is not light enough in the tunnel
2470 from the electric lamps to enable one to see one's way through ... so
2471 that it is necessary to carry a lamp in one hand and a note-book in the
2472 other, to record the different measurements." The Colonel then gave
2473 some startling news. He declared that, according to his measurements,
2474 somebody had advanced the length of the tunnel some seventy yards since
2475 his inspection on July 15.
2476 
2477 When this report reached the Board of Trade, the department, outraged,
2478 made a motion before the High Court of Justice to cite the tunnel
2479 promoters for contempt. However, a cloud of doubt descended on
2480 the issue when the tunnel promoters claimed in court that Colonel
2481 Yolland's calculations were in error. The motion was put off with the
2482 promoters' promising to obey to the letter the demands of the Board of
2483 Trade. Later on in the month, Colonel Yolland, after making a further
2484 inspection, conceded that, owing to the difficulties of working in the
2485 tunnel, he had made some error of calculation. The true advance made in
2486 the tunnel since July 15, he said, was thirty-six yards—a figure he
2487 said was confirmed by the tunnel company's engineer. Colonel Yolland
2488 reported that the company engineers had installed a pump at the eastern
2489 end of the tunnel to force out the water accumulating there. He added,
2490 somewhat testily, "Of course men had to be employed in erecting this
2491 pump in the tunnel and in working it when it was ready, and as the
2492 boring machine has not been made use of for the purpose of cutting
2493 chalk, this ... conclusively proves what I had stated in my former
2494 reports, that it was not necessary to cut an inch of chalk for the
2495 purpose of ventilating and draining the tunnel."
2496 
2497 Altogether, and with all the difficulties they had encountered, the
2498 tunnel promoters had succeeded in boring the tunnel for a distance
2499 of 2,100 yards, or a little less than a mile and a quarter, toward
2500 France. The operations at the French end, which came to a stop in March
2501 of 1883, completed 2,009 yards of pilot tunnel from the bottom of the
2502 shaft by the cliffs at Sangatte.
2503 
2504 In the middle of August, the Government, having received all the
2505 reports from the War Office and the Board of Trade on the subject
2506 of the tunnel, caused the rival Channel-tunnel bills that had been
2507 brought before it to be set aside, and at the same time Mr. Chamberlain
2508 announced in the House of Commons that the Government had decided to
2509 propose, early the following year, the appointment of a Joint Select
2510 Committee of the House of Lords and the House of Commons to dispose
2511 of the whole tunnel question as conclusively as possible. In the
2512 meantime, he announced the Government's intention of publishing a
2513 Blue Book containing all the principal documents and correspondence
2514 concerning the tunnel. The Blue Book was issued in October, and once
2515 again the wrath of the English press fell upon the tunnel project and
2516 its promoters. The tone of the press comment was most majestically
2517 represented by an editorial in the London _Times_, which had started
2518 off the press campaign against the project the year before. The _Times_
2519 wrote that, unless it was much mistaken, "the publication of the Blue
2520 Book will be found to have closed the whole question of the Channel
2521 Tunnel for a long time to come."
2522 
2523  Undermined by land, overmined at sea, sluice-ridden at its entrance,
2524  and liable to asphyxiating vapors at intervals, the Tunnel will hardly
2525  be regarded by nervous travellers as a very pleasant alternative even
2526  to the horrors of seasickness....
2527 
2528  The whole system of defense must forever be at the mercy of
2529  blunderers, criminals, and madmen. It is true that we take somewhat
2530  similar risks in ordinary railway travelling, but imagination counts
2531  for a good deal in such matters, and the terrors of the Channel
2532  Tunnel under an adequate system of defense might easily affect the
2533  imagination so strongly as to render the terrors of seasickness
2534  insignificant by comparison.
2535 
2536 Caught between the forces of claustrophobia and xenophobia, Sir Edward
2537 Watkin's great tunnel project was just about done for. In Westminster,
2538 angry citizens exhibited their feelings by smashing all the windows of
2539 the Channel Tunnel Company offices there. In the following year, the
2540 promised new investigation into the tunnel question was undertaken by
2541 a joint Parliamentary committee presided over by Lord Landsdowne. The
2542 committee met fourteen times, examined forty witnesses, and asked them
2543 fifty-three hundred and ninety-six questions. Not unexpectedly, the
2544 witnesses included Sir Garnet Wolseley, now Lord Wolseley. That Lord
2545 Wolseley in the interim had not changed his opinions on the perilous
2546 consequences of a tunnel is evident from his response to just five of
2547 the hundreds of questions put to him by the committee members.
2548 
2549  5233: ... I think you said that supposing anyone in this room were to
2550  go to the barrack gates [at any of the forts at Dover at night] and to
2551  knock at the door, the door would at once be opened?—The wicket would
2552  be opened to you.
2553 
2554  5234: Would it be the case if the person who went there had a hundred
2555  men in his company?—The man inside would not know that he had them,
2556  he would never suspect a hundred men being outside; but I would go
2557  further and say, even supposing that he would not open the barrack
2558  gates, the barrack gates are very easily knocked in.
2559 
2560  5235: Are there any drawbridges there?—There are, but they are very
2561  seldom, if ever, drawn up in Dover.
2562 
2563  5236: You said that if the tunnel were in existence, it would be
2564  necessary that the conditions of life in Dover should be altered;
2565  would that be one of the conditions which would be altered?—Yes.
2566 
2567  5237: And the drawbridges would be up at night?—The drawbridges would
2568  be up at night, and nobody would be allowed to go in or out after a
2569  certain hour.
2570 
2571 When all the evidence was in, a majority of the joint Parliamentary
2572 committee sided with the views of Lord Wolseley and voted against any
2573 Parliamentary sanction's being given to a Channel tunnel.
2574 
2575 Sir Edward Watkin kept right on promoting his tunnel project for quite
2576 a while. By 1884—a year, incidentally, when Lord Wolseley was called
2577 away from the country to command the British expeditionary force that
2578 arrived too late at Khartoum to relieve General Gordon—Sir Edward was
2579 still doing his best to bring the British Army around to his viewpoint
2580 on the tunnel. A series of contemporary illustrations in the London
2581 illustrated weekly publication _The Graphic_ records some views of
2582 a tunnel party held during that year for a group of British Army
2583 officers. One of the engravings shows a number of officers preparing
2584 to descend into the tunnel; the caption reads, "I say, Dear Chappie,
2585 if we invade France through the Tunnel, I hope I shan't be told off
2586 to lead the Advanced Guard." The visit was further reported on in an
2587 accompanying article by one of a few journalists accompanying the
2588 party. From this, it appears that the condition of the tunnel hadn't
2589 improved since the time that Colonel Yolland nearly split his head open
2590 in it. "Under foot for a great portion of the way," the author said,
2591 in describing how the visitors were drawn along the long gallery on
2592 canvas-hooded trolleys, "was ankle deep in slush," and he went on to
2593 quote from the report of one of his colleagues:
2594 
2595  Onward to no sound, save the splashing made by the tall workmen [who
2596  drew the trolleys] tramping through the mud and the drip, drip, drip
2597  of the water upon the hood above our heads, we are dragged and pushed
2598  ... under the bed of the Channel.... Sometimes, in the fitful flashes
2599  of light, the eye rests on falling red rivulets, like streams of
2600  blood, flowing down the damp walls. So we go on until the electric
2601  lamps cease altogether, and the long, awful cave is enveloped in a
2602  darkness that would be impenetrable but for the glimmer of a few
2603  tallow candles stuck into the bare walls of the cutting.
2604 
2605 At the end of the tunnel the action of the boring machine was briefly
2606 demonstrated, this time by special permission of the Board of Trade,
2607 and then the party was escorted out of the tunnel and taken to a
2608 good lunch, presumably at the Lord Warden Hotel. Another engraving
2609 in the same issue of _The Graphic_ shows members of the same party
2610 of officers, chairs drawn slightly back, sitting about a luncheon
2611 table. The monocled guests, ranged on each side of a clutter of
2612 bottles, potted ferns, place cards, and an interesting variety of
2613 glasses—including, as one can see fairly clearly, champagne glasses,
2614 claret glasses, and hock glasses—are being addressed by a bearded
2615 speaker. They look dazed. Yet while using his best softening-up
2616 techniques on the Army officers, Sir Edward did not let up his fire on
2617 his principal opponents among the military. Thus, during 1884, when
2618 he reintroduced his Tunnel Bill on the floor in Parliament (it was
2619 rejected by 222 votes to 84) he ridiculed the anti-tunnel generals for
2620 publicly confessing an inability to cope with defending a frontier
2621 "no bigger than the door of the House of Commons." Dealing with the
2622 question of British insularity, he also introduced the argument that
2623 since France and England had once been united as part of the same
2624 continental land mass his opponents, in refusing to unite them again,
2625 were openly showing distrust of the wisdom of Providence in having
2626 created the connection in the first place. This last assertion really
2627 incensed the editors of the London _Times_, who had been steadily
2628 invoking Providence as their ally against the tunnel all along. The
2629 _Times_ ran an editorial declaring angrily that no stronger reason
2630 could be found for distrusting the whole tunnel scheme than the fact
2631 that Sir Edward had been reduced to using such an argument. The _Times_
2632 added, severely, "Ordinary people will probably be content to take the
2633 world as it appears in historic times. Everything that we possess and
2634 are—our character, our language, our freedom, our institutions, our
2635 religion, our unviolated hearths, and our far-extended Empire—we owe
2636 to the encircling sea; and when Englishmen try to penetrate the designs
2637 of Providence they will not seek them in geological speculations, but
2638 will rather thank Him Who 'isled us here.'"
2639 
2640 Sir Edward, in his indomitable fashion, not only pursued his
2641 geological speculations but also kept pursuing the tunnel question
2642 in Parliament. In 1887, a year in which he changed the name of the
2643 Submarine Continental Railway Company to that of the Channel Tunnel
2644 Company (he had taken over the long-moribund rival company in 1886),
2645 he went on such a powerful campaign on behalf of a new Channel Tunnel
2646 Bill that it was defeated in the House by only seventy-six votes. In
2647 1888, he tried again, and even managed to persuade Mr. Gladstone,
2648 now the leader of the Opposition, that the Channel could be tunneled
2649 under with propriety. As a result, Mr. Gladstone, in June 1888, gave
2650 his personal support to Sir Edward's Tunnel Bill and delivered a long
2651 Parliamentary speech on the subject. In this dissertation the venerable
2652 statesman, while taking nothing back about the wisdom of Providence
2653 in placing the Channel where it was, said he had now come to feel
2654 that a Channel tunnel could be used "without altering in any way our
2655 insular character or insular security, to give us some of the innocent
2656 and pacific advantages of a land frontier." But even Mr. Gladstone's
2657 support couldn't swing it. Parliament would not agree to the tunnel. At
2658 last, after all these setbacks, Sir Edward had to consider the tunnel
2659 project as a lost cause, if only temporarily. He stopped promoting
2660 it in 1894, having become involved in the meantime in a couple of
2661 alternate projects—a railway tunnel between Scotland and Ireland and a
2662 ship canal in Ireland between Dublin and Galway. Also, in 1889, he had
2663 become chairman of a company to erect at Wembley Park, near London, a
2664 great iron tower, modeled on the Eiffel Tower, which was to be known as
2665 the Watkin Tower. The Watkin Tower didn't get very high. Only a single
2666 stage was completed, and this was opened to the public in 1896; it was
2667 demolished eleven years later. Sir Edward Watkin died at Northenden,
2668 Cheshire, in 1901.

2674 
2675 
2676 The advent of the Entente Cordiale in 1904 provided the basis for the
2677 next attempt to revive the tunnel scheme. In 1907, the English Channel
2678 Tunnel Company, by now under the chairmanship of Baron Frederic Emile
2679 d'Erlanger, a banker, made another attempt to obtain Parliamentary
2680 approval for a tunnel. This time, the company had the advantage
2681 of bringing to bear on its behalf solid engineering studies and
2682 twentieth-century technology. The trains in the tunnel were now to be
2683 all electric, and the difficult task of evacuating the spoil from the
2684 tunnel during its construction was to be carried out by an ingenious
2685 new method, invented by a Frenchman named Philippe Fougerolles, of
2686 pulverizing it and mixing it with sea water into a soft slurry, then
2687 pumping the slurry out of the tunnel through pipelines. This time,
2688 while all the old arguments for and against the tunnel were being
2689 rehashed in Parliament, the tunnel promoters came up with a novel
2690 proposal designed to demonstrate the benign intentions toward England
2691 of the French Government and to allay the suspicions of the anti-tunnel
2692 faction in England. They suggested that the French end of the tunnel
2693 emerge from the side of a steep cliff on the shore of the Channel at
2694 Wissant, not far from Sangatte. The sole access to the tunnel entrance
2695 on the French side then would be made through a long horseshoe-shaped
2696 railway viaduct extending for some distance out over the sea and
2697 doubling back again to join, a mile or so away from the tunnel
2698 entrance, the French coastal rail line. Thus, the French suggested, the
2699 British fleet would be at liberty to sail up and array itself at any
2700 point offshore in a time of national emergency and at its convenience
2701 to shell the viaduct and tunnel entrance to smithereens. Expounding
2702 on the advantages of this plan in the pages of the _Revue Politique
2703 et Parlementaire_, one of the two principal architects of the 1907
2704 tunnel plan, Albert Sartiaux—the other was the engineer, Sir Francis
2705 Fox—encouragingly pointed out that such a viaduct not only would
2706 constitute the most perfect target imaginable for the guns of the Royal
2707 Navy, but also "would be a magnificent _point de vue_ for tourists."
2708 These inducements were insufficient, however. Parliament turned down
2709 the tunnel again. And a Labor M.P. declared, "If the Channel were
2710 tunneled, the Army and Navy estimates would speedily grow beyond the
2711 control of the most resolutely prudent financier. Old-age pensions
2712 would dwindle out of sight, and a shilling income tax would soon be
2713 regarded as the distant dream of an Arcadian past."
2714 
2715 Just before the First World War, the Channel Tunnel Company, headed by
2716 Baron Frederic Emile d'Erlanger's son, Baron Emile Beaumont d'Erlanger,
2717 embarked on another crusade. In 1913, a deputation representing ninety
2718 M.P.s favorable to the tunnel scheme visited Herbert Asquith, the
2719 Prime Minister, to ask for the Government's approval for the scheme,
2720 and the Liberal London _Daily Chronicle_, editorially proclaiming that
2721 the advent of the airplane had put an end to England's position as an
2722 island, came through with a big pro-tunnel press campaign. However, the
2723 _Times_ of London continued to stick firmly to its ancient position,
2724 and it ran an editorial restating its old arguments against the tunnel
2725 and ingeniously adding a new one—that even if there were no real
2726 possibility of invasion, the very existence of the tunnel "might even
2727 itself lead to a precipitation of war, if in case of international
2728 complications it was considered necessary, in a possible moment of
2729 confusion, to close the tunnel at the Dover end." In July 1914,
2730 less than a fortnight before the outbreak of war, the Committee of
2731 Imperial Defense turned the tunnel scheme down again. But the value
2732 of a Channel tunnel as a supply route for the Allied armies on the
2733 Continent continued to be debated throughout the war, and when it was
2734 over Marshal Foch declared publicly that "If the English and the French
2735 had had a tunnel under the Channel in 1914, the war would have been
2736 shortened by at least two years." The Marshal was promptly made the
2737 honorary president of the Comité Français du Tunnel.
2738 
2739 In postwar England, the tunnel project began to obtain heavy support
2740 in Parliament. By 1924, some four hundred M.P.s—about two-thirds of
2741 the House—were said to be for it, and the new Labor Prime Minister,
2742 Ramsay MacDonald, promised a careful and sympathetic review of the
2743 Government's position on the tunnel. He called all of the four living
2744 former Prime Ministers—Lord Balfour, Herbert Asquith, Lloyd George,
2745 and Stanley Baldwin—into consultation on the matter, as well as the
2746 Committee of Imperial Defense. The Prime Ministers met for forty
2747 minutes and rejected the scheme again, and MacDonald told Parliament
2748 that the Government felt postwar military developments had "tended,
2749 without exception, to render the Channel tunnel a more dangerous
2750 experiment" than ever. Winston Churchill protested the decision. "I do
2751 not hesitate to say that it was wrong," he told the House.
2752 
2753 In 1929, everybody had a go at the tunnel once more, and very elaborate
2754 engineering studies were made on the subject by well-established
2755 engineering firms and were carefully examined by a special Government
2756 committee, with particular attention being given to the contention
2757 of pro-tunnel people that the construction of a Channel tunnel would
2758 provide badly needed work for Englishmen in depression times. The
2759 report of the Government's committee was, with a single dissension,
2760 favorable to the construction of the tunnel. But the Committee of
2761 Imperial Defense still was to have its say, and in May 1930 it
2762 rejected the project. This time the rejection was made primarily on
2763 two grounds, according to a high British military man who was later a
2764 member of that body. The first of these, he says, was the fear of the
2765 military that the successful construction of a Channel tunnel would
2766 so adversely affect England's Channel shipping trade that the Channel
2767 ports were likely to fall into ill repair and the harbors to start
2768 silting up—dangerous conditions in periods of national emergency; the
2769 second was their fear that if Britain became involved in another war on
2770 the Continent, the tunnel would suddenly become a traffic bottleneck
2771 through which it would be difficult to move war supplies and equipment
2772 quickly and on the massive scale required. A month after this adverse
2773 verdict by the military, a motion was nonetheless put forward in the
2774 House of Commons for approval of the tunnel, and this time such a large
2775 group of M.P.s was favorable to the scheme that the motion failed to
2776 carry by only seven votes.
2777 
2778 For most of the thirties, the tunnel project just drifted along in a
2779 dormant state. Once every so often, when things were generally slack,
2780 the press would carry a feature story on it, and the annual meetings of
2781 the Channel Tunnel Company, still gamely presided over by Baron Emile
2782 Beaumont d'Erlanger, were always good for a paragraph tucked somewhere
2783 into the financial pages under mildly mocking headlines, such as
2784 "Hope Eternal," "The Channel Tunnel Again," or, in one of the popular
2785 dailies, just "The Poor Old Tunnel."
2786 
2787 The outbreak of the Second World War, however, far from putting the
2788 Channel tunnel completely out of sight, revived the issue, for a
2789 time, anyway. In November 1939 the French Chamber of Deputies passed
2790 a resolution calling for the construction of a tunnel; early in 1940,
2791 Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain—the son, incidentally, of Joseph
2792 Chamberlain, who as president of the Board of Trade had ordered the
2793 tunnel workings stopped back in the eighties—turned the tunnel project
2794 down again in a parliamentary reply. The retreat from Dunkirk gave
2795 pro-tunnel and anti-tunnel people the opportunity of putting forth
2796 their arguments about the tunnel once more, with some variations—with
2797 the pro-tunnelers claiming that a Channel tunnel might have enabled the
2798 British Expeditionary Force to keep a bridgehead in France, and the
2799 anti-tunnelers countering that the same tunnel would have given German
2800 paratroopers the opportunity of seizing the English end and using it as
2801 a bridgehead for the invasion of England.
2802 
2803 Then, after the fall of France, when the Germans were busily making
2804 preparations for the invasion of England, the question arose among
2805 the British military as to whether the enemy might not just possibly
2806 attempt to reach England by surreptitiously tunneling underneath the
2807 Channel. As a consequence, the War Office called in an eminent British
2808 civil engineer, the late Sir William Halcrow, and asked him to make
2809 a study of the question of whether the Germans could pull off such a
2810 feat. "We examined the situation quite carefully and concluded that,
2811 provided we kept reasonably alert, the Germans could not dig the tunnel
2812 without being detected," an engineering colleague of Sir William
2813 Halcrow's on the survey said a while ago. He added, "Their difficulty
2814 would lie in the disposal of the spoil. They couldn't get rid of it
2815 without our seeing from the air that something peculiar was going on.
2816 If they tried to dump the spoil into the sea at night it would have to
2817 be done at the turn of the tide, and the chalk would leave a cloud in
2818 the sea that would not be dissipated by daylight. If they pulverized
2819 the spoil, converted it into a slurry, and pumped it well out to sea,
2820 we would be able to spot the chalk cloud too, and even if they tried
2821 other means of dispersing the spoil the very process of dispersal would
2822 call for such extensive installations that we would soon be on to them."
2823 
2824 In 1942, somebody at the War Office had another look into the tunnel
2825 situation, this time for the purpose of finding out if it would be
2826 practical for the British to start tunneling under the Channel—the
2827 idea presumably being the creation of a supply route to France ahead
2828 of an Allied invasion, with the last leg of the route being completed
2829 once the Allied Armies had installed themselves on the French
2830 coast. Again, several prominent British civil engineers were called
2831 into consultation, but the subject was abruptly dropped, without
2832 investigation of the problem of disposing of the spoil, when the
2833 engineers estimated that a tunnel probably would take eight years to
2834 complete—three years longer than the war then was expected to last.
2835 
2836 From 1940 on, the British kept a routine watch on their reconnaissance
2837 photographs for signs of tunneling on the French side, especially
2838 around the site of the still existing shaft of the French Tunnel
2839 Company at Sangatte. Early in 1944, R.A.F. and U.S.A.F. reconnaissance
2840 showed signs of unusual installations being made near Sangatte, but
2841 these later turned out to be unconnected with subterranean workings. As
2842 it happened, they were launching sites for V-2 bombs.
2843 
2844 The actual handling by the Germans of the old tunnel shaft during the
2845 occupation of France was rather peculiar. Far from trying to continue
2846 the existing tunnel in the early part of the Occupation, they treated
2847 it in contemptuous fashion, using the shaft as a dump for old chunks
2848 of machinery, used shell casings, bits of rubbish, and broken slabs of
2849 concrete. Later on, their attitude changed drastically. They sealed
2850 the top of the shaft with a poured-concrete platform. Then, in weirdly
2851 romantic fashion, they built a large rim of fitted stone around the
2852 platform to create an ornamental-wall effect, and added around the
2853 well a grass-and-flagstone terrace complete with formal walks and
2854 sets of monumental-looking stone steps laid out in symmetrical style.
2855 Apparently their notion was to bring the tunnel aesthetically into
2856 harmony with a military cemetery they installed between the tunnel
2857 entrance and the sea.
2858 
2859 After the war, the Channel-tunnel project continued to languish in
2860 prewar fashion. If anything, even less than before was heard in the
2861 press about the activities of the Channel Tunnel Company. The company's
2862 headquarters at the Southern Railway offices at London Bridge were
2863 blown up in the blitz, and all the company's records were destroyed.
2864 For some time, while attempts were made to piece together duplicate
2865 lists from Government files, the Channel Tunnel Company didn't even
2866 know who the majority of its stockholders were, but that didn't
2867 matter too much, considering the circumstances. Baron Emile Beaumont
2868 d'Erlanger, the chairman, had died in 1939, and his place on the Board
2869 was taken by his nephew, Leo d'Erlanger, also a banker. Leo d'Erlanger,
2870 now a spry, elegant, silver-haired gentleman in his sixties, brightly
2871 confesses to having had little interest in the tunnel until about
2872 twelve years ago. "I was brought up in a home where the Channel tunnel
2873 was a family religion, and, to tell the truth, I didn't give it too
2874 much thought," he says. "My grandfather used to talk about it when I
2875 came back for the holidays from Eton. 'Politics,' they all used to say.
2876 'The only reason why the tunnel isn't built is politics.' I never paid
2877 much attention. I thought it was an old dodo and never had anything to
2878 do with it in my Uncle Emile's lifetime. When he died and I took over,
2879 I used to look forward with dread to the annual general meetings. I
2880 had nothing to say. I considered the whole thing moribund. For a few
2881 years we met, I remember, at the Charing Cross Hotel, which belonged to
2882 the Southern Railway [a successor to Sir Edward Watkin's South-Eastern
2883 Railway], and the secretary was an elderly retired man by the name of
2884 Cramp, who once had something to do with the Southern Railway, I think.
2885 We used to have difficulty in getting a quorum. I suppose we would
2886 manage to get four or five people to turn up."
2887 
2888 However, the lost-cause atmosphere began to undergo a change in
2889 1948, when Sir Herbert Walker, the former general manager of the
2890 Southern Railway, which was taken over by British Railways in the
2891 nationalization program of that year, acted temporarily as chairman
2892 of the Channel Tunnel Company. Walker came to believe that the
2893 Channel-tunnel scheme could be a practical one in the postwar era, and
2894 he brought it to life again. Largely as a result of his persuasions,
2895 a Parliamentary study group began to look into the tunnel question
2896 once more, and the Channel Tunnel Company's lobbyists once more set
2897 about building up pro-tunnel opinion among M.P.s. It was just like old
2898 times for the pro-tunnelers, but with one significant difference. By
2899 the mid-fifties, it became clear that in the emerging age of rockets
2900 bearing nuclear warheads the traditional strategic arguments of the
2901 British military against the construction of a Channel tunnel would
2902 no longer have the same force that they had once had. And as for the
2903 old fears of military conscription in peacetime and high taxes, they
2904 had long ago been realized without a tunnel. It was therefore an event
2905 to make the hearts of all pro-tunnelers beat fast when, one day in
2906 February 1955, in the House of Commons, Harold Macmillan, then Minister
2907 of Defense, in answer to a parliamentary question as to whether the
2908 Government would have objections of a military nature to raise against
2909 a Channel tunnel, replied, "Scarcely at all."
2910 
2911 This seemed like a green light to D'Erlanger, but for a while he
2912 couldn't quite decide what to do after seeing it flash on. Early in
2913 1956, however, he went to see Paul Leroy-Beaulieu, who was a director
2914 of the French Tunnel Company—the Société Concessionnaire du Chemin
2915 de Fer Sous-marin entre la France et l'Angleterre—and the grandson
2916 of Michel Chevalier, who had founded the company in 1875. D'Erlanger
2917 suggested that, since the tunnel was a common ancestral interest, the
2918 two of them have another try at promoting it. Leroy-Beaulieu agreed,
2919 and he suggested that as the Suez Canal Company's concession in Egypt
2920 was due to run out in 1968, and might not be renewed, the Suez Company
2921 might possibly be interested in turning to a Channel tunnel as its
2922 next project. Sure enough, the principals of the Suez Company, whose
2923 headquarters were in Paris, were interested in the idea, but the sudden
2924 seizure of the Canal by Colonel Nasser in July of that year kept
2925 them too distracted to pursue the tunnel project just then. In the
2926 meantime, quite independently of these tunnel developments in Paris and
2927 London, two young international lawyers in New York, Frank Davidson
2928 and Cyril Means, Jr., became intrigued by the possibility of a tunnel
2929 between England and France. Davidson and Means happened to have good
2930 connections in Wall Street, and after they established contact with the
2931 two existing tunnel companies by letter, Means went over to London and
2932 Paris early in February of 1957 to investigate the tunnel situation
2933 and to offer the tunnel people there—and the Suez Canal Company—the
2934 chance of obtaining some substantial American financial backing for the
2935 construction of a tunnel if it proved to be a practical proposition.
2936 The tunnel people in Europe showed varying degrees of interest in the
2937 proposal, and to strengthen their position, Davidson and Means, with
2938 another friend, an engineer, Arnaud de Vitry d'Avancourt, formed a New
2939 York corporation called Technical Studies, Inc., with the announced
2940 purpose of financing technical investigations and promoting the
2941 construction of a Channel tunnel.
2942 
2943 In April 1957, the Suez Canal Company, which by then had given up
2944 any hope of regaining control of the Canal, jumped into the tunnel
2945 picture by announcing that it intended to collaborate with the English
2946 and French tunnel companies to have made a very detailed geological
2947 survey of the Channel bed to determine the practicability of a tunnel.
2948 The tunnel came into the news again. When, at the seventy-sixth
2949 annual meeting of the Channel Tunnel Company, in London, D'Erlanger
2950 got up to confirm the latest development, he did so not before the
2951 usual handful of disillusioned shareholders, but in a room packed
2952 with people who had suddenly rediscovered and dusted off old Channel
2953 Tunnel Company stock certificates. A correspondent from the _Times_
2954 of London who was present reported of the stockholders' reaction to
2955 the speech of the company's chairman on the possibilities of seriously
2956 reviving the tunnel project that it took only a few minutes "to excite
2957 their minds to a pleasurable pitch" and that "at least one member
2958 of Mr. d'Erlanger's audience darted out in the middle of his speech
2959 to instruct his broker to buy in shares." According to the _Times_,
2960 the only note of doubt was struck by a stockholder at the end of the
2961 meeting, which lasted half an hour:
2962 
2963  Mr. John Elliott, who bought his shares for a song almost, asked where
2964  the company's workings were. Did they really exist? He had visited
2965  Dover, and neither police, shopkeepers, nor the county surveyor could
2966  tell him where they were. He suggested that the board prove their
2967  existence by escorting a nominated half-dozen shareholders on an
2968  eye-witness excursion.
2969 
2970 Little attention was paid to the objector. The _Times_ reported that
2971 "other shareholders pooh-poohed his scepticism," and the meeting broke
2972 up. It was a far cry from the days of Sir Edward Watkin's special
2973 trains to Dover for tunnel parties. However, the price of Channel
2974 Tunnel Company stock, which had been available for years on the London
2975 Stock Exchange for as low as sixpence, rose to more than ten shillings
2976 by the day of the meeting and shortly thereafter rose rapidly, until by
2977 May 20 it reached twenty-six shillings and ninepence—six shillings and
2978 ninepence more than the price of the first Channel Tunnel Company stock
2979 in 1876.
2980 
2981 The British press, on the whole, reacted to the latest tunnel
2982 development in tolerant fashion. There was, however, a spirited
2983 discussion of the subject in an article in the _Daily Telegraph_
2984 in the spring of 1957, marked by an attack on the whole scheme by
2985 Major-General Sir Edward Spears. General Spears wrote that although
2986 powerful interests now appeared to be backing the construction of
2987 a Channel tunnel, the objections raised to the project in the past
2988 were as valid as ever. "Such a tunnel would bind this island to the
2989 Continent irrevocably [and] would soon link our fate to that of our
2990 Continental neighbors," he asserted, and he added that if the new
2991 scheme were persisted in, steps should be taken to enlighten the public
2992 before the Government was committed to approving it. General Spears's
2993 position was supported by Lord Montgomery. Choosing Trafalgar Day as
2994 the most appropriate time to express himself on the subject, Lord
2995 Montgomery said at a Navy League luncheon in October of 1957, "There
2996 is talk these days of a Channel tunnel. Strategically it would weaken
2997 us. Why give up one of our greatest assets—our island home—and make
2998 things easier for our enemies? The Channel tunnel is a wildcat scheme
2999 and I am wholeheartedly opposed to it.... I hope that the Navy League
3000 will have nothing to do with it."
3001 
3002 However, by Trafalgar Day the pro-tunnelers were hard at it, too.
3003 In July 1957, the four main interests involved in the scheme—the
3004 English and French Channel-tunnel companies, the Suez Canal Company and
3005 Technical Studies—had combined to create an organization called the
3006 Channel Tunnel Study Group to contract for modern technical surveys of
3007 the whole tunnel question. The new group is said to have spent over
3008 a million dollars on having these surveys made. The studies included
3009 a very detailed survey of the Channel bed with modern electronic
3010 geophysical equipment and deep rock borings and sea-bottom samples made
3011 across the neck of the Channel, as well as microscopic examination
3012 of these rock samples to determine their microfossil composition and
3013 probable position in the strata from which they were taken. Curiously
3014 enough, while the geological survey was under way, somebody on the
3015 project took the trouble to inquire into the old French hydrographic
3016 surveys for a Channel tunnel, and after some diligent searching he
3017 turned up, in a dusty waiting room of a disused Paris suburban railroad
3018 station, where it had been stored for an age, a collection of thousands
3019 of the sea-bottom samples made in the French Channel-tunnel surveys
3020 of 1875 and 1876. All of the samples were found neatly packed away in
3021 test tubes and ticketed, and the searchers even uncovered a case of the
3022 geological specimens that Thomé de Gamond himself had recovered in 1855
3023 by his naked plunges to the bottom of the Channel in the neighborhood
3024 of the Varne. The geologists weren't interested in going by way of the
3025 Varne any more, but many of the old 1875-76 samples were taken away for
3026 microfossil examination as part of a check on how the results of the
3027 old surveys compared with the new. Except for some variations relating
3028 to the extent of the cretaceous outcrop in the middle of the Channel,
3029 the findings tallied nicely.
3030 
3031 The new Study Group had a number of other elaborate surveys made, too,
3032 on the economic and engineering problems involved in the creation and
3033 operation of a Channel tunnel or an equivalent means of cross-Channel
3034 transport. Besides developing plans for a bored tunnel—the projected
3035 double-rail tunnel, interconnected at intervals by cross-passages,
3036 is essentially a modern version of William Low's plan of the 1860s,
3037 with an extra small service tunnel being added between the main
3038 tunnels—the Study Group's engineering consultants developed in detail
3039 schemes for a Channel bridge, an immersed railway tube, an immersed
3040 road tube, a combined immersed tube with two railway tracks, and a
3041 four-way road system on two levels. The bridge proposed would be an
3042 enormous affair with approximately 142 piers and with four main spans
3043 in the center of the Strait each 984 feet long. These spans would
3044 tower a maximum of 262-1/2 feet above sea level to allow the largest
3045 ships in the world to pass underneath with plenty of room to spare.
3046 The bridge would take no longer to build than a road tunnel, but it
3047 would cost about twice as much, and in addition it would be expensive
3048 and difficult to maintain and would present a hazard to navigation.
3049 The immersed tube proposed for either rail or road traffic (but not
3050 both) probably would cost about the same as a bored tunnel and might
3051 be constructed in four years. A combined road-rail tube would take
3052 about the same time to build, but would be more expensive even than a
3053 bridge. Among the best-known schemes for a combined tube is that of
3054 a Frenchman, André Basdevant, who has proposed one with a four-lane
3055 highway and a two-track rail line. This scheme would pretty much
3056 run along the old Cap Gris-Nez-Folkestone route of Thomé de Gamond,
3057 and it would even have, like most of Thomé de Gamond's schemes, an
3058 artificial island in mid-channel on the Varne. As for the latest
3059 scheme for a laid, rather than a bored, tube, it would be no different
3060 from Thomé de Gamond's plan in 1834 for a submerged tube, and as in
3061 that old plan a trench would be dug, by operations conducted at the
3062 surface, across the Channel bottom to receive the tube, which would be
3063 prefabricated in sections and towed out to sea to be laid down in the
3064 trench a section at a time. This time the digging of the trench would
3065 be carried out from a huge above-surface working platform, something
3066 like an aircraft-carrier deck on sets of two-hundred-foot-high stilts,
3067 that would jack itself up and move on across the Channel as the work
3068 progressed. From these and other surveys, the Study Group concluded
3069 by March 1960 that the best means of linking Britain and France would
3070 be by a rail tunnel, either bored or immersed, which, while avoiding
3071 the difficult ventilation problems of a long road tunnel, would make
3072 for convenient transport of cars and trucks by a piggyback system. It
3073 further proposed that the tunnel be operated jointly by the British and
3074 French Government-run railways under a long lease from an international
3075 company yet to be formed, and that only the bare tunnel itself be
3076 privately financed, with the British and French state-run railways
3077 providing the installations, terminals, and rolling stock at a cost of
3078 some twenty million pounds.
3079 
3080 When D'Erlanger announced the Study Group's proposals, calling all the
3081 latest tunnel laborings "a last glorious effort to get this through,"
3082 the British press received the news with big headlines on the front
3083 pages but with considerable indignation on its editorial pages. The
3084 core of the objections was not of a military nature but had to do
3085 with the number of financial concessions that the tunnel people were
3086 asking from the British and French Governments (that is, taxpayers)
3087 as a basis for going ahead with the scheme. The general attitude of
3088 the press was that the British Government should have nothing to do
3089 with some of the financial concessions asked. There were a good many
3090 references, all very familiar to a reader of the press attacks during
3091 the tunnel uproar back in the eighties, to "promoters," and the tone of
3092 editorial reaction was fairly well typified by a sarcastic article in
3093 _The Economist_ entitled "Pie Under the Sea." And the _Times_ ran an
3094 editorial declaring snappily that, as the proposals stood, "the light
3095 at the end of the tunnel would be either bright gold for the private
3096 owners of the £20 million of equity capital or Bright Red for the
3097 Anglo-French taxpayer." Then, shortly afterward, the tunnel came under
3098 public attack by Eoin C. Mekie, chairman of Silver City Airways, which
3099 in the years since the Second World War has ferried more than three
3100 hundred thousand cars and a million and a half passengers by air to and
3101 from the Continent. Mekie denounced the tunnel scheme as "commercial
3102 folly" and described it as "a feat of engineering which is already made
3103 obsolete by the speed of modern technical advances." Other attacks were
3104 made, too, from the enthusiasts over the future of Hovercraft, the
3105 heavier-than-air craft, still in the experimental stage, which ride
3106 on a cushion of air; and from, not unexpectedly, Channel shipping and
3107 ferry interests. Then Viscount Montgomery, in a newspaper interview,
3108 returned to the attack on the tunnel on the ground of its undermining
3109 what he called "our island strategy." He also observed in particular,
3110 when asked about the feasibility of blowing the tunnel up in case
3111 of war or threatened war, "The lessons of history show that things
3112 that ought to be blown up never are, as Guy Fawkes discovered." And
3113 Major-General Spears in the spring of 1960 gave fuller vent to his
3114 anti-tunnel views in a pamphlet that he wrote and had circulated
3115 privately. Its general tenor was set by General Spears's assertion that
3116 "the Channel saved us in 1940 and may well save us again," and that
3117 "The British people need no tunnels." And he asked, "Who would have
3118 believed that in the last war the Germans would not have destroyed the
3119 enormously important bridge over the Rhine at Remagen? But they failed
3120 to do so."
3121 
3122 To all such criticism as this, the Channel-tunnel people reacted not
3123 with the kind of broadsides that Sir Edward Watkin would have let
3124 loose in the heyday of the Channel-tunnel controversy but by hiring a
3125 public-relations outfit headed by a man called E. D. O'Brien, a former
3126 publicity director for the Conservative party, who is said to be known
3127 among his colleagues as Champagne Toby. O'Brien's champagne appears to
3128 be weaker stuff than Sir Edward Watkin's; the pro-tunnel publicity his
3129 outfit puts out seems to consist of things like a small booklet called
3130 "Channel Tunnel, the Facts," which an O'Brien assistant has described
3131 as "a sort of child's guide, in Q. and A. form, you know, about the
3132 tunnel."
3133 
3134 As soon as the British press fell on the promoters for making the
3135 demands they did for Government financial guarantees, the promoters
3136 came up with a set of counter-proposals. They offered to finance not
3137 only the tunnel itself but also the terminals and approaches on both
3138 sides; they further proposed leasing the tunnel directly to the two
3139 governments, thus avoiding the earlier requirement of governmental
3140 guarantee of the bonds.
3141 
3142 When the subject of constructing a Channel tunnel will come up for a
3143 decision one way or the other before the British Cabinet and Parliament
3144 again nobody seems willing to predict, and what the Cabinet will decide
3145 nobody seems willing to predict, either. However, D'Erlanger, who
3146 says that he would consider another tunnel thumbs down by the British
3147 Government or Parliament "a negation of progress," is always happy to
3148 talk about the benefits a Channel tunnel would confer upon Europe.
3149 "You have fifty million people on this side of the Channel and two
3150 hundred million plus on the Continental side. If you join them by a
3151 small hyphen, I think it _must_ facilitate trade on both sides," he
3152 says. "I like to think of the tunnel as a kind of engagement ring that
3153 would bind Britain's Outer Seven into a workable marriage with the six
3154 countries of the Common Market. Think of shipping goods from Rome to
3155 Birmingham or from Edinburgh to Bordeaux without breaking bulk, and at
3156 half the cost! It's high time Europe had a manifestation of progress
3157 along the lines of the St. Lawrence Seaway, and I think a Channel
3158 tunnel would be the great civil-engineering feat of the century for
3159 Europe."
3160 
3161 In the meantime, with all the brave words, and all the money poured
3162 into the project, the Channel Tunnel Company still has something of a
3163 phantom air about it. It doesn't have a regular staff—D'Erlanger is a
3164 busy City banker—and it has no real office of its own. D'Erlanger's
3165 banking headquarters are at the investment house of which he is a
3166 partner, Philip Hill, Higginson, Erlangers, Ltd., along Moorgate,
3167 but no Channel Tunnel Company records are kept there. The nearest
3168 thing to a headquarters for the Channel Tunnel Company is a set of
3169 Victorian offices on Broad Street Place, in the City, occupied by a
3170 firm of "secretaries" called W. H. Stentiford & Co. These offices are
3171 reached by a very ancient and slow ironwork-gate lift, and a sign in
3172 the corridor shows that W. H. Stentiford & Co. is the representative
3173 of an astonishing variety of companies, including the Channel Tunnel
3174 Company, Ltd., and a number of outfits with such exotic corporate
3175 names as the Tea Share Trust, Ltd., Uruwira Minerals, Ltd., Dominion
3176 Keep (Klerksdorp, Ltd.), and Klerksdorp Consolidated Goldfields, Ltd.
3177 Inside, amid a clutter of ticking clocks, great ledgers, old safes
3178 emblazoned with peeling coats of arms, great piles of papers, and trays
3179 of teacups, a small staff of round-shouldered retainers toils away
3180 vicariously over the affairs of these far-flung organizations—making
3181 up accounts and annual or quarterly statements, filling out and
3182 recording stock certificates, answering letters, and so on. All this
3183 clerkly activity is presided over by an eminently respectable and
3184 precisely mannered man by the name of P. S. Elliston, who also arranges
3185 board meetings for his many client companies in a room set aside at
3186 Stentiford's for the purpose. Mr. Elliston's organization "took on"
3187 the Channel Tunnel Company in the early forties, and all its annual
3188 meetings since 1947 have been held at Stentiford's, with Mr. Elliston
3189 present in his capacity of representative of his firm of secretaries.
3190 Mr. Elliston finds things changed a bit from the time when the Channel
3191 Tunnel Company first became one of his firm's clients. In those old
3192 days, he says, the whole annual meeting could generally be disposed
3193 of in between five and ten minutes, with only a couple of directors
3194 being present—Mr. Elliston having thoughtfully bought one share of
3195 Channel Tunnel Company stock to enable himself to vote in case no
3196 other shareholder besides a couple of directors could be persuaded to
3197 turn up to make a quorum of three. Now, he says, it may sometimes take
3198 twenty-five minutes or even as long as forty-five minutes to transact
3199 necessary business. As for Channel Tunnel Company stock, it has
3200 fluctuated all the way from sixpence to fifty shillings—its price one
3201 day in 1959 at a time when the company's balance sheet showed a cash
3202 balance of just £161. The price of the stock at the time this book was
3203 written was about twenty-two shillings, and the company's cash in hand
3204 (in 1961 it issued a little more stock to keep going) was £91,351 "and
3205 a few shillings." Owing to the wartime destruction of its records and
3206 the difficulty of tracking down all the old transactions, the Channel
3207 Tunnel Company still doesn't know who all its stockholders are, and,
3208 conversely, there are quite a few people scattered about who probably
3209 aren't aware that they are company stockholders.
3210 
3211 Mr. Elliston describes the last fifteen years or so of the company's
3212 history as containing "several periods where there was very keen
3213 interest" in the tunnel scheme, especially in 1957 and 1958, with
3214 Stentiford's being subjected, he says, to "a persistent spate of
3215 enquiries," including calls from newspaper reporters and letters from
3216 schoolboys asking why the tunnel was never built.
3217 
3218 Some time ago, when I was in England, I decided to take a trip down
3219 to the coast between Folkestone and Dover to the scene of the violent
3220 tunnel controversy of the eighties. I had heard that the shaft of the
3221 old Shakespeare Cliff gallery in which Sir Edward Watkin did so much of
3222 his promoting and entertaining, as well as tunneling, had been sealed
3223 off many years ago, but I was aware that the Abbots Cliff gallery, or
3224 part of it, still existed. Through the good offices of Leo d'Erlanger
3225 and Harold J. B. Harding, the vice-president of the Institution of
3226 Civil Engineers, who has directed many of the latest technical surveys
3227 on the proposed Channel tunnel, I arranged to go down one day from
3228 London to Folkestone and to be taken into the old Abbots Cliff tunnel.
3229 Written permission had to be obtained from the Government for the
3230 visit, and the necessary arrangements had to be made well in advance
3231 with officials of British Railways, the present owner, representing
3232 the Crown, of the coastal lands once the domain of Sir Edward Watkin's
3233 South-Eastern Railway Company. Harding explained to me that since the
3234 tunnel entrance was kept locked up and lay in a not readily accessible
3235 part of the cliffs facing the sea, it would be practical for me to make
3236 the visit only under fairly good weather conditions, and then under
3237 the escort of people equipped with lamps and the means of opening up
3238 the tunnel entrance. "You may get a bit wet and a bit dirty, so don't
3239 wear a good suit," Harding added, and he went on to say that he had
3240 seen to it that I would be shown around the tunnel by a civil engineer
3241 named Kenneth W. Adams, from the district office of British Railways at
3242 Ashford, Kent—Adams being, in Harding's words, "a keen engineer who
3243 has become something of a hobbyist on the old tunnel workings."
3244 
3245 Wearing an old suit, I duly took a train early one fair morning in
3246 autumn, from Charing Cross, and when I got off at Folkestone Central
3247 Station, Adams, a stocky, cheerful man who seemed to be about forty,
3248 was waiting for me. He had a little car waiting outside the station,
3249 and when he got into it, he introduced me to an assistant sitting in
3250 the driver's seat named Jack Burgess. "Jack's grandfather was a surface
3251 worker at the tunnel workings at Shakespeare Cliff," Adams said as
3252 Burgess started the car up. "Jack was just telling me that he remembers
3253 his grandfather telling him, when he was a boy, about Lord Palmerston
3254 coming down to visit the tunnel in 1881. The old chap remembered that
3255 the food that was brought into the tunnel for parties of visitors from
3256 the Lord Warden Hotel at Dover came in hay boxes—that is, in big
3257 wicker boxes interlined with a thick layer of hay to keep the food
3258 warm."
3259 
3260 Burgess drove us through the outer part of Folkestone toward the sea at
3261 a pretty good clip, with the little car buzzing away like a high-speed
3262 sewing machine, and in a very little time, after climbing up a long,
3263 gentle slope by the back of the cliffs, we drew up on the heights of
3264 East Cliff, a kind of promontory within Eastwear Bay, which lies to
3265 the north-east of Folkestone Harbor. There, in two broad curves to the
3266 left and right of us, the precipitous face of the white chalk cliffs
3267 gleamed, like huge ruined walls with grassed-over rubble piled about
3268 their base, in hazy sunlight. Far below us, and stretching away into
3269 the haze, lay the Channel, gray and, for the time being, pretty calm.
3270 A hundred feet or so from where our car stopped was a massive round
3271 stone tower, its sides tapering in toward the top like a child's sand
3272 castle; two similar towers lay some distance from us in the direction
3273 of Folkestone. These, Adams explained, were Martello towers, formerly
3274 cannon-bearing fortifications that were installed in prominent places
3275 all along the Dover-Folkestone coastal area during the invasion scares
3276 early in the nineteenth century to repel surprise landings by the
3277 troops of Napoleon Bonaparte. (The three Martello towers comprised
3278 the main artillery defenses of Folkestone Harbor even as late in the
3279 century as the time of the great tunnel controversy in the eighties.)
3280 Then he pointed to the cliffs stretching to the north-east. "You see
3281 that large white building on top of the cliff almost at the very end of
3282 the bay? That's Abbots Cliff, and the tunnel is at the base of it," he
3283 said. "We'll take you down that way in a couple of minutes, but first
3284 I'd like to show you something that may interest you."
3285 
3286 We walked a short distance down a path by East Cliff to a point where
3287 we could see, as we couldn't previously, the rail line that ran along
3288 the coast, partly through rail tunnels piercing the cliffs, and partly
3289 over the land that rose above their base. Then Adams pointed out to
3290 me something jutting horizontally out of the chalk cliffs a little
3291 above and to the side of the railroad cutting. It was a large and
3292 long-rusted collection of wheels, gears, and cams, all compounded
3293 together into the shape of some fantastic Dadaist engine. "What you
3294 see there is the remains of the last machine ever tried out for boring
3295 a Channel tunnel," Adams said. "That's the Whittaker boring machine,
3296 an electrically driven affair, powered by a steam-driven generator,
3297 and it was tried out here after the First World War. Actually, it was
3298 developed by the Royal Engineers for mining under the German lines, and
3299 in 1919 Sir Percy Tempest, who was chief engineer of the South East &
3300 Chatham Railway—an amalgamation of the South-Eastern Railway and the
3301 London, Chatham & Dover Railway, which in turn, by further amalgamation
3302 with other lines, became the Southern Railway—thought it might do
3303 for the Channel tunnel. In 1919 he asked permission from the Board
3304 of Trade to drive a new heading from the old Number Three ventilating
3305 shaft at the eastern end of Shakespeare Cliff a little way under the
3306 foreshore, and got it, but he changed his mind and decided to try the
3307 machine in the chalk down here. The Whittaker machine cut a tunnel
3308 twelve feet in diameter, and some time between 1921 and 1924 they drove
3309 a heading into the chalk, just at the point where it's sticking out
3310 now, for some four hundred feet. They never quite removed the machine
3311 from the heading when they were finished, but it was maintained right
3312 up to the outbreak of the Second World War, when it became derelict."
3313 
3314 Adams and I walked back to the car. As we did so, he revealed himself
3315 as being pro-tunnel. "It's a tragic thing, this tunnel business, I
3316 think. If the tunnel had been built forty or fifty years ago, just
3317 think of what an asset to Europe it would have been," he said. We
3318 packed ourselves in, and Burgess drove us down a very rough, narrow
3319 road to the level of the railroad line. There, by a maintenance shed,
3320 a small, thin workman was waiting for us. He was wearing an old cloth
3321 peaked cap, a white duffel coat, and rubber knee boots, and by his feet
3322 he had ready-lighted Tilley lamps—similar in appearance to miners'
3323 lamps but operated by kerosene under pressure, like a Primus stove.
3324 Adams and Burgess jumped out of the car, and Burgess unlocked and
3325 opened up the rear trunk. I got out of the car, too. Then the workman,
3326 whom Adams addressed as Jim, disappeared briefly into the shed and came
3327 out with a pile of knee boots, which he began flinging into the car
3328 trunk. "We'll be needing these," Adams remarked to me. Next Jim brought
3329 out an enormous wrench, at least two feet long, and slung that on top
3330 of the protesting rubber boots, and then he came up with an armful of
3331 duffel coats, which he handed around. We put them on and all of us got
3332 into the car; the little workman wordlessly, with a wide gaptoothed
3333 grin, squeezed into the back seat with me and settled back with the
3334 two big lighted Tilley lamps on his lap. The lamps gave off a gentle
3335 roaring sound, like subdued blowtorches, and they gave off heat that
3336 warmed the whole back of the car.
3337 
3338 We drove off down a narrow, steep, tortuously winding, and very rugged
3339 road, through a kind of wilderness of concrete rubble and piles of
3340 old heavy wooden construction beams, toward the base of the cliffs,
3341 and when we finally got there, we continued along the wide top of a
3342 concrete sea wall for a considerable distance until the wall suddenly
3343 narrowed and the car could go no farther.
3344 
3345 We all got out, and Adams, Burgess, and I took off our shoes and put
3346 on the knee boots that Burgess got out of the trunk; and, with Jim and
3347 Burgess leading the way and bearing between them the glowing Tilley
3348 lamps and the giant wrench, we continued on foot along the sea wall,
3349 now as narrow as the sidewalk of a small city street. The chalk cliffs
3350 towered perhaps a couple of hundred feet above us. "The tunnel is about
3351 three-quarters of a mile ahead along the sea wall," Adams remarked
3352 as he walked beside me, and as we went along he explained that his
3353 primary job at British Railways was the design of sea defenses between
3354 Folkestone and Dover to combat erosion. "It's a good job you didn't
3355 pick a later time in the year to visit the tunnel," he went on. "This
3356 sea wall would hardly be negotiable on foot when the water's rough, and
3357 in winter, with the sou'westers blowing in especially, we have some
3358 real shockers."
3359 
3360 After another fifteen minutes or so of walking along an area where the
3361 cliffs rose back beyond a sort of terrace formed by old landslides—the
3362 railway line ran along this terrace in the open—Adams told me that
3363 the tunnel entrance was not far off. A few hundred feet farther on, we
3364 finally reached it—a small recessed place in the grassy rubble at the
3365 base of the cliff terrace and, set into it, a four-foot-square door
3366 of rough, thick wood encased by a frame of very old and very heavy
3367 timbers. The door was hinged with heavy gate hinges and secured not by
3368 a padlock but by a very large metal nut, which Jim now attacked with
3369 his great wrench.
3370 
3371 As he wrestled with it, Adams, smiling, remarked that the entrance
3372 wasn't a very big one, considering the size of the Channel-tunnel
3373 project. "I once brought a Canadian executive, a rather
3374 impressive-looking fellow, down here by request, in '57, I think it
3375 was," he recalled. "It seemed very important to him to inspect the
3376 entrance to the tunnel. When I took him along the sea wall and showed
3377 him this entrance, he took a look at it and just burst out laughing.
3378 I asked him what was up. He went on laughing, and finally he told me
3379 why. He said he was employed by a large American oil company, and that
3380 his company had sent him over here to spy out the possibility of buying
3381 up land for filling stations near the entrance to the proposed Channel
3382 tunnel. Actually, of course, nobody knows precisely where a new tunnel
3383 would come out on the English side, and it would be very doubtful
3384 whether they would make use of any of the old workings."
3385 
3386 The little workman unloosened the nut, and, with various groans
3387 and creaks, the door to the tunnel allowed itself to be pulled and
3388 shouldered open. Then, one by one, we stooped down and entered the
3389 tunnel through the small opening. When my eyes adjusted themselves from
3390 the light of day to the light of the Tilley lamps we had brought with
3391 us, I found that we were standing in a square-timbered heading perhaps
3392 six feet high and about the same in width. The floor, like the roof,
3393 was timbered, and from the roof, as well as from parts of the sides
3394 of the heading, a pale fungus growth drooped down. The atmosphere was
3395 pretty dank. Just inside the entrance, either hanging from big rough
3396 nails protruding from the wooden walls or lying to one side on the
3397 floor, there was a clutter of various objects—rusty chains, augers,
3398 lengths of decaying rope, candles, and a couple of lobster pots, the
3399 presence of which Adams explained to me. "They get washed up from
3400 time to time, and our lads, when they find them, put them in here for
3401 safekeeping," he said. Slowly we made our way into the tunnel. There
3402 was room for a set of narrow-gauge rail tracks, but most of the thin
3403 rails had been torn up, and a number of them lay piled to our right by
3404 the wall. On the left, untracked and abandoned, lay one of the rail
3405 trolleys that obviously had been used for hauling out spoil. The little
3406 rusted wheels on which it rested were of clearly Victorian design,
3407 with spokes elaborately arranged in curlicued fashion. "This is the
3408 access heading we're in," Adams told me as we found our way along,
3409 heads down. "The chalk carted out from the Beaumont boring machine was
3410 taken through here and dumped right into the sea outside the entrance.
3411 But this access heading wasn't the first to be built; it was dug by
3412 hand from the direction in which we're going, from the bottom of a
3413 vertical shaft sunk from the level of the South-Eastern Railway line
3414 seventy-four feet up above this concrete lining we're coming to now.
3415 As you see—" Adams took a Tilley lamp from Burgess and flashed it on
3416 the roof of the concrete lining—"the shaft has been closed up long
3417 ago. Now we'll go on. This first stretch is taking us in a northerly
3418 direction."
3419 
3420 After going a short distance, we came to another concrete lining. This,
3421 Adams said, was to reinforce the tunnel at the point where it passed
3422 underneath the railway line. We went on again, this time walking on a
3423 dirt floor, and then we came to a timbered junction, from which the
3424 tunnel branched off again to the right in the north-east direction that
3425 was originally intended to bring it into line with the gallery at
3426 Shakespeare Cliff, while to the left there was a low-roofed chamber
3427 that probably once housed a siding and a maintenance workshop for the
3428 Beaumont boring machine. Then, walking now on half-rotted planks, in
3429 the warm light of the restlessly moving Tilley lamps, we entered the
3430 circular, unlined tunnel of Lower Chalk—a smooth, light-gray cavern,
3431 seven feet in diameter, that stretched far ahead to disappear into
3432 darkness. Our footing was slippery, and a small stream of water ran
3433 in the direction from which we had come in a rough gutter cut in the
3434 chalk, but the tunnel at this point seemed surprisingly dry for a hole
3435 that had lain unlined for some eighty years, and the stream of water
3436 draining away didn't seem to me to be really any greater than the one
3437 in the Orangeburg pipe that drains seepage from under the cellar of my
3438 summer house in Connecticut.
3439 
3440 We had gone only a little way along the chalk tunnel when Adams,
3441 walking ahead of me, began flashing his light along the wall and
3442 then stopped and motioned me to come and look at the spot where he
3443 had focused his lamp. I did so and saw, cut into the chalk in crude
3444 lettering, the following inscription:
3445 
3446   THIS
3447   TUNNEL
3448   WAS
3449   BUGN
3450   IN
3451   1880
3452   WILLIAM SHARP
3453 
3454 However, this was not exactly how the inscription went, for its author,
3455 after finishing it, obviously had decided that "BUGN" didn't look
3456 right, and, being unable to erase the incision, he had had another go
3457 at it, inscribing the second try to one side and partly over the first,
3458 so that the intended "begun" now came out like "BEGUBNUGN." But with
3459 all the crudeness of the inscription, the author had been careful with
3460 the lettering, even to point of conscientiously incising serifs on the
3461 "T"s and "E"s.
3462 
3463 While the light played about the inscription, I could see clearly, on
3464 the tunnel face, the ringlike marks left by individual revolutions of
3465 the cutting head of the Beaumont boring machine. After a few moments we
3466 moved on again, and eventually, after trudging over ground that became
3467 increasingly slippery, we came to a point where some of the chalk
3468 had given way, filling the tunnel about a quarter of the way up with
3469 debris. Adams said that the going got a bit better later on but that we
3470 were likely to find ourselves in water over our knee boots if we went
3471 any farther. At that point, impressed with the sight of all the fallen
3472 rock about and by the realization that we were in a seven-foot hole at
3473 least a quarter of a mile inside a huge cliff on a deserted stretch of
3474 coast, I felt as though I had seen enough. I suddenly realized what a
3475 smart idea Sir Edward Watkin had had in providing visitors with that
3476 champagne lift while they were well under the sea. So we turned back
3477 again and slowly, in silence, made our way out of Sir Edward's first
3478 tunnel.
3479 
3480 When I stepped through the tunnel entrance into the light, it seemed
3481 very noisy outside. Sea gulls were shrieking overhead, and the Channel
3482 waves were roaring and heaving insistently. I had a slight headache,
3483 and I mentioned this to Adams. "Oh, yes, I have the same thing," he
3484 said. "Although the air in the tunnel is remarkably fresh, considering
3485 the length of time it's been locked up and the fact that there's only
3486 one entrance, there isn't quite as much oxygen in it as one might
3487 want." Jim began to lock up the entrance again, and while he was doing
3488 so, Adams suggested that we might see if we could spot the entrance
3489 shaft on the plateau above us. We climbed up the cliffside, and after
3490 a while we located it, a filled-in depression resting in a mass of
3491 bramble bushes. We waded through the bushes and stood over the remains
3492 of Number One shaft, still feeling a bit headachy. As we stood there,
3493 we picked and ate a few blackberries still left on the bushes from
3494 summer. "They're quite good," Adams said.
3495 
3496 After we had had some lunch in Folkestone, Adams suggested that before
3497 I went back to London I might want to take a look at the site of the
3498 old Number Two shaft and the main tunnel at Shakespeare Cliff, even
3499 though the Number Two shaft and the Number Three ventilating shaft had
3500 been long ago closed up. I was agreeable to that, and Burgess drove
3501 us, by way of Dover, to a point along a back road, from which we could
3502 walk to the top of Shakespeare Cliff from the land side. While Burgess
3503 stayed in the little car, Adams and I set off up a long slope to the
3504 cliff head, walking along the edge of a harrowed field, the soil of
3505 which seemed to be riddled with the kind of large flints typical of the
3506 Upper Chalk layer.
3507 
3508 On the way up, Adams told me what had happened to the main tunnel
3509 and shaft after the workings were finally stopped by the Board of
3510 Trade. "Everything stopped dead at the tunnel workings until 1892,"
3511 Adams said. "By then, Sir Edward Watkin knew he was beaten on the
3512 Channel tunnel, so he tried a different kind of tunneling, and the
3513 South-Eastern Railway engineers began boring for coal a matter of a few
3514 yards away from the tunnel shaft. They went down to 2,222 feet with
3515 their boring, at which level they met a four-foot seam of good-quality
3516 coal, and the company obtained authority by an act of Parliament to
3517 mine for coal under the foreshore. As for the Channel-tunnel shaft
3518 itself, it was abandoned in 1902 and filled up with breeze—ashes and
3519 slag—from the colliery, and the Number Three ventilation shaft at the
3520 eastern end of Shakespeare Cliff was also filled with breeze in the
3521 same year. But the colliery never paid off any better than the tunnel
3522 project. It ran into trouble around 1907 or 1908, and then the owners
3523 decided they'd have a try at getting iron ore out of the workings,
3524 and so all the mineral mining rights were bought by the Channel Steel
3525 Company, but the iron mining didn't prosper any more than the coal
3526 mining. The Channel Steel Company went into voluntary liquidation in
3527 1952, and all the mining rights passed to the original freeholders, who
3528 are now the British Government."
3529 
3530 Adams and I climbed over a wooden fence stile, and after a couple of
3531 more minutes of uphill walking we arrived at the top of Shakespeare
3532 Cliff. We approached to a point near the edge and kneeled in the tall
3533 grass, buffeted by a strong afternoon wind that struck us squarely in
3534 the face. It was a magnificent view. The Channel lay very far below
3535 us, and although I could not see the coast of France because of the
3536 haze—Adams said that on a fine day anybody could see clearly the
3537 clock tower outside Boulogne—I could see shipping scudding along in
3538 whitecaps in the middle of the Strait. To the left of us, not far away,
3539 lay the Admiralty Pier at Dover, the one that once had the great gun
3540 which the _Illustrated London News_ had imaginatively depicted in the
3541 act of blowing the tunnel entrance to pieces at the first sign of a
3542 French invasion of England through the tunnel.
3543 
3544 Then, on hands and knees, we crawled against the pommeling wind to
3545 the very edge of the cliff, and lying on our stomachs peered straight
3546 down upon the site of the Shakespeare Cliff tunnel. I still had traces
3547 of the headache I had picked up while creeping around in the depths
3548 of the Abbots Cliff tunnel and it was a dizzying change for me now
3549 to peer three hundred feet down a sheer cliff face, but it was worth
3550 it, even though there was nothing so startling to see. Far below us
3551 lay a plateau with a couple of railway sidings on it. There were no
3552 buildings about, and certainly nothing that resembled any trace of a
3553 mine entrance. "British Railways had to build a sea wall around the
3554 whole Shakespeare Cliff area a few years ago because of the erosion
3555 from the Channel, and when we were doing that we cleaned out all the
3556 old mine workings," Adams said. "One of the last buildings to go was a
3557 shed that the old custodian of the works used to live in. His name was
3558 Charlie Gatehouse. He died about ten years ago at the age of ninety.
3559 He had worked as a timberman on both the Abbots Cliff and Shakespeare
3560 Cliff tunnels, and he took up the first sod when they dug the shaft
3561 down here. He used to tell about how one day Mr. Gladstone came down
3562 into the tunnel."
3563 
3564 Then Adams pointed out to me exactly where the entrance to Number Two
3565 shaft had been. It lay by the third rain puddle to the left near one of
3566 the sidings. I enjoyed the thought of having its location fixed in my
3567 mind, and I believe Mr. Adams did, too. We gazed down silently. "Just
3568 imagine, if the Board of Trade hadn't stopped the works, a man might
3569 have been able to go right on to Vladivostock without getting out of
3570 his train," Adams said after a while. And he added earnestly, "But I
3571 think they'll build the tunnel yet."
3572 
3573 Since my visit to the tunnel, the tendency of events has been to
3574 reinforce the brave hopes of Adams and his fellow pro-tunnelers. To be
3575 sure, while even the most dedicated of tunnel promoters may be prone
3576 to his black moments while pondering the nature and the effects of
3577 traditional British insularity—one of the most distinguished, Sir
3578 Ivone Kirkpatrick, the president of the Tunnel Study Group, a while ago
3579 observed with some touch of bitterness that it seemed as though "men
3580 may be flying to the moon before Britons can make a reasonable surface
3581 journey to Paris"—Britain's decision to seek full membership in the
3582 European Common Market, and the agreement of the French and British
3583 Governments to hold official talks on the construction of either a
3584 tunnel or a bridge across the Channel, have given the pro-tunnelers
3585 more solid reason for hope than perhaps has ever existed in the ranks
3586 of these visionaries in a century and a half. In the past, it was
3587 never possible for proponents of the tunnel to advance their cause
3588 with any success so long as their advocacy was not based on the prior
3589 existence of any profound change in Britain's traditional economic and
3590 strategic special and separate place in Europe, or of any change in
3591 the peculiar British sense of being an island people apart. But now
3592 such changes have taken place, or are in the process of taking place.
3593 Britain's strategic position has been profoundly altered by the advent
3594 of nuclear and rocket armaments. Her political and economic position
3595 has been as profoundly altered by the withering away of the British
3596 Empire and by the successful emergence of a new European commonwealth
3597 in the form of the Common Market. And the ancient British sense of
3598 being an island race apart seems to have been steadily eroded by a
3599 strange kind of rootlessness, partly arising out of Britain's altered
3600 place in the world, and as a general accompaniment of the intrusion of
3601 such uninsular influences as the jet airplane, commercial television,
3602 high-powered advertising, expense-account living, and the spread of
3603 installment buying. Notwithstanding all her misgivings on the subject
3604 of committing herself to abandonment of her ancient aloofness from the
3605 Continent, Britain can hardly ignore the implications of the relentless
3606 march of that process once described by the Duke of Wellington over a
3607 century ago in the heyday of the sailing ship, when he observed that
3608 Britain and the Continent were rapidly becoming joined by an "isthmus
3609 of steam."
3610 
3611 Now that so many of the conditions that have made for England's
3612 traditional economic, military, and cultural insularity have gradually
3613 subsided, like the ancient Wealden Island that once lay in what is now
3614 the Strait of Dover, the question of connecting Britain physically
3615 to the Continent is at last in the realm of practical political
3616 possibility. In spite of all her misgivings about the abandonment
3617 of her privileged relationships with the countries of the British
3618 Commonwealth, it seems as though Britain has no choice ahead but to
3619 throw in her lot with the Common Market, which has proved itself to be
3620 such an astonishing success in its four years of existence.
3621 
3622 Since 1958, when the special trade arrangements between the countries
3623 of the European Economic Community went into effect, up to 1960,
3624 their industrial production increased by 22 per cent, while Britain's
3625 industrial production increased only 11 per cent. And it has been
3626 estimated that by 1970 the Gross National Product of the Common Market
3627 countries will double that of 1961. This estimate does not take into
3628 account Britain's joining the Common Market, either; when she does so,
3629 as it seems she must, the Common Market boom will be a spectacular
3630 one; the member countries will then be serving a market of more than
3631 200 million people. Precisely what Britain's entry into the Common
3632 Market would mean in terms of increased commercial intercourse between
3633 Britain and the Continent no one knows, but the increase plainly would
3634 be enormous, and considering this potentiality, proponents of the
3635 Channel tunnel are not backward in claiming that Britain's present
3636 cross-Channel transportation facilities are grossly inadequate to meet
3637 the demands ahead. They are even inadequate, the pro-tunnelers claim,
3638 for coping with Britain's present needs.
3639 
3640 As things stand, some 8 million passengers and about 400,000 vehicles
3641 cross the Channel in a year. Of these, 3.3 million passengers and
3642 about 100,000 vehicles go by air. Most of this traffic crisscrosses
3643 the Channel in the four peak summer months and results in severe
3644 bottlenecks in the existing means of communication. (A motorist who
3645 wishes to take his car abroad either by air or sea-ferry during the
3646 peak season must book a passage some months ahead of time, and if he
3647 can't make it on the assigned date "he runs the risk," as one of the
3648 tunnel promoters has put it, "of being marooned on this island for
3649 several more months.") Even without taking into account Britain's
3650 probable entry into the Common Market, the number of vehicles crossing
3651 Britain and the Continent probably will double itself by 1965.
3652 
3653 The Channel Tunnel Study Group people claim that neither the existing
3654 air nor sea-ferry services are equipped to handle anything like this
3655 potential load. They estimate that without construction of a tunnel,
3656 the British and French Governments, through their nationalized rail and
3657 air lines, will be obliged to spend some $90,000,000 in the next five
3658 years to replace or expand existing transport facilities if they are
3659 to keep up with the increase in cross-Channel traffic expected in that
3660 time without Britain's participation in the Common Market. As for the
3661 capacity of the tunnel, the promoters claim that all the road vehicles
3662 that crossed the Channel in 1960 could easily be carried through the
3663 tunnel in three or four days. As for the transporting of merchandise,
3664 11,000,000 tons of it are now being moved across the Channel in a year,
3665 most of this in bulk form—coal, for example—which it would not be
3666 practical to send through a tunnel. But of this freight, well over a
3667 million tons of nonbulk goods could, the Study Group declares, be sent
3668 by tunnel, and at about half the rates now prevailing.
3669 
3670 Taking into account such economic advantages, the great boon to
3671 tourism that they believe a tunnel would represent, and the intangible
3672 psychological impetus that they claim a fixed link between France
3673 and Britain would give to the dream of a politically as well as
3674 economically united Europe, the pro-tunnelers believe that the
3675 construction of their railway under the Channel would be just about the
3676 greatest thing to happen to Britain in this century.
3677 
3678 The Channel Tunnel Study Group people, as it turned out late last year,
3679 are not alone in their ambitions for a physical connection between
3680 France and Britain. Last fall, when the French and British Governments
3681 decided—on British initiative—to negotiate with each other on a fixed
3682 connection between the two countries, it became clear that a dark horse
3683 had been entered in the Channel sweepstakes with the publicizing of the
3684 new proposal for a cross-Channel bridge made by a new French company
3685 that is headed by Jules Moch, a former French Minister of Interior.
3686 The bridge proposed by the new French company would be a multipurpose
3687 affair of steel capable of carrying not only two railroad lines but
3688 five lanes of motor traffic and even two bicycle tracks. It would
3689 extend between Dover and a point near Calais. Its width would be 115
3690 feet and its height 230 feet, allowing (as the Tunnel Study Group's
3691 proposed bridge scheme would) ample clearance for the largest ocean
3692 liners afloat. Its length would be 21 miles; it would rest on 164
3693 concrete piles 65 feet in diameter and sunk 660 feet apart. Motorists
3694 would travel along it, without any speed limit, at a peak rate of
3695 5,000 vehicles an hour, and an average toll of about $22.50 per car.
3696 The bridge would take between four and six years to construct, and as
3697 for the cost, that would run to about $630,000,000—or $266,000,000
3698 more than the estimated cost of a rail tunnel. Despite some backing
3699 that the new French bridge group appears to have established for its
3700 scheme among French commercial circles, the chances are that the
3701 British Government, as representatives of a maritime nation, will
3702 have a number of objections to this plan for spanning the Channel.
3703 A principal objection—a technical one that has confounded all the
3704 Channel bridge planners from Thomé de Gamond's day onward—is the
3705 hazard to navigation within the Strait of Dover that a bridge would
3706 create. The English Channel is one of the most heavily trafficked sea
3707 lanes in the world, and considering the violent state of wind and sea
3708 within the Strait of Dover for much of the year—as well as the heavy
3709 Channel fogs—insuring safe passage between the piers of such a bridge
3710 for all the thousands of ships that pass through the Strait every year,
3711 in all weathers, would pose formidable problems even in the era of
3712 radar. Also, the Channel-tunnel advocates, who already have considered
3713 a bridge and pretty much rejected the idea because of its high cost,
3714 point to other difficulties standing in the way of the bridge idea—for
3715 example, the requirements of international law, which would make
3716 necessary a special treaty signed by all countries (including Russia)
3717 presently sending ships through the Channel before such an obstruction
3718 to navigation could be constructed; the difficulties, with all the bad
3719 weather, of keeping such an enormous structure in good repair; and
3720 the dangers of Channel gales to light European cars traversing the
3721 bridge. (The French bridge advocates claim that they could reduce the
3722 winds buffeting traffic to a quarter of their intensity by installing
3723 deflectors on the sides of the traffic lanes; to this the tunnel
3724 advocates counter that boxing cars in traffic lanes for some twenty-one
3725 miles would create a psychological sense of confinement that drivers
3726 would find far more intimidating than riding on a train under the
3727 sea.) But the main objection to the bridge is its cost. It could only
3728 be built with the help of substantial government subsidies, and the
3729 experience of the pro-tunnelers is that such subsidies are almost
3730 impossible to obtain.
3731 
3732 Whatever the merits of the two schemes, they are certain to be
3733 considered in quite a different atmosphere now than they were back in
3734 the seventies, when, according to the observations that Sir Garnet
3735 Wolseley subsequently made to Sir Archibald Alison's scientific
3736 committee that investigated the tunnel question, "the tunnel scheme was
3737 ... looked upon as fanciful and unfeasible. It was not then regarded
3738 as having entered within the zone or scope of practical undertakings.
3739 No one believed that it would ever be made and, if mentioned, it
3740 always raised a smile, as does now any reference to flying machines
3741 as substitutes for railways." On August 28, 1961, things somehow
3742 seemed to come full circle when the London _Times_, which had started
3743 all the opposition in the press to the tunnel eighty years earlier,
3744 devoted a leading editorial to discussion of the subject of a fixed
3745 connection between France and Britain. The _Times_ started out in
3746 familiar fashion for a tunnel editorial by quoting from Shakespeare's
3747 "This royal throne" speech, but then it went on to concede in stately
3748 fashion that times had changed and that "Britain must soon decide
3749 whether to leap over the wall, to become a part of Europe." The _Times_
3750 discussed the merits of the latest tunnel and bridge schemes in tones
3751 of expository reasonableness, without committing itself to either one
3752 scheme or the other, and without accusing the would-be moat-crossers,
3753 as of old, of flaunting the will of Providence. And the _Times_ wound
3754 up its editorial on a meaningful note by observing, in reference to
3755 the quotations with which the editorial had been prefaced, that while
3756 Shakespeare had the first words, John Donne deserved the last:
3757 
3758 "No man is an island, entire of itself."
3759 
3760 To which all the tunnel dreamers, after all their years of adversity in
3761 the face of the insular British character, reasonably can say Amen.

3824 Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
3825 by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
3826 person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
3827 1.E.8.
3828 
3829 1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
3830 used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
3831 agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
3832 things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
3833 even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
3834 paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
3835 Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
3836 agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
3837 electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
3838 
3839 1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
3840 Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
3841 of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
3842 works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
3843 States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
3844 United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
3845 claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
3846 displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
3847 all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
3848 that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
3849 free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
3850 works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
3851 Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
3852 comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
3853 same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
3854 you share it without charge with others.
3855 
3856 1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
3857 what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
3858 in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
3859 check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
3860 agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
3861 distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
3862 other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
3863 representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
3864 country other than the United States.
3865 
3866 1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
3867

3872 phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
3873 performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

3880   United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
3881   you are located before using this eBook.
3882 
3883 1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
3884 derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
3885 contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
3886 copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
3887 the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
3888 redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
3889 Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
3890 either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

3893 
3894 1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

3896 must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
3897 additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

3915 to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
3916 other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
3917 version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm website
3918 (www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
3919 to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
3920 of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
3921 Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
3922 full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
3923 
3924 1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
3925 performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
3926 unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

3932 * You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
3933   the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
3934   you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
3935   to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
3936   agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
3937   Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
3938   within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

3946   you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
3947   does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
3948   License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
3949   copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
3950   all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
3951   works.
3952 
3953 * You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

3964 from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
3965 the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
3966 forth in Section 3 below.
3967 
3968 1.F.
3969 
3970 1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
3971 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
3972 works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
3973 Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
3974 electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
3975 contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
3976 or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
3977 intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
3978 other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
3979 cannot be read by your equipment.
3980 
3981 1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
3982 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
3983 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
3984 Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
3985 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
3986 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
3987 fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
3988 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
3989 PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
3990 TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
3991 LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
3992 INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
3993 DAMAGE.
3994 
3995 1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
3996 defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
3997 receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
3998 written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
3999 received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
4000 with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
4001 with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
4002 lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
4003 or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
4004 opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
4005 the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
4006 without further opportunities to fix the problem.
4007 
4008 1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
4009 in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
4010 OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
4011 LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
4012 
4013 1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
4014 warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
4015 damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
4016 violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
4017 agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
4018 limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
4019 unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
4020 remaining provisions.
4021 
4022 1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
4023 trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
4024 providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
4025 accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
4026 production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
4027 electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
4028 including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
4029 the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
4030 or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
4031 additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
4032 Defect you cause.
4033 
4034 Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
4035 
4036 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
4037 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
4038 computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
4039 exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
4040 from people in all walks of life.
4041 
4042 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
4043 assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
4044 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
4045 remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
4046 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
4047 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
4048 generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
4049 Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
4050 Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
4051 www.gutenberg.org
4052 
4053 Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
4054 Archive Foundation
4055 
4056 The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
4057 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
4058 state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
4059 Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
4060 number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
4061 Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
4062 U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.
4063

4068 
4069 Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
4070 Literary Archive Foundation
4071 
4072 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
4073 widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
4074 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
4075 freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
4076 array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
4077 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
4078 status with the IRS.
4079 
4080 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
4081 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
4082 States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
4083 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
4084 with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
4085 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
4086 DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
4087 state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
4088 
4089 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
4090 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
4091 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
4092 approach us with offers to donate.
4093 
4094 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
4095 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
4096 outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
4097 
4098 Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
4099 methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
4100 ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
4101 donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate
4102 
4103 Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
4104 
4105 Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
4106 Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
4107 freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
4108 distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
4109 volunteer support.
4110 
4111 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
4112 editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
4113 the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
4114 necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
4115 edition.
4116 
4117 Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
4118 facility: www.gutenberg.org
4119 
4120 This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
4121 including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
4122 Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
4123 subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
